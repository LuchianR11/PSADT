10/10,"As a viewer that actually went to TIFF and witnessed this film and didn't want to believe the hype, it is an absolute MASTERPIECE and Phoenix is a certified legend.",JF500,9/10/2019,"I was a person that saw all the hype and claims of masterpiece as overreacting and overblown excitement for another Joker based film. I thought this looked solid at best and even a bit too pretentious in the trailer, but in here to say I was incredibly wrong. This is a massive achievement of cinema that's extremely rare in a day and age of cgi nonsense and reboots. While this is somewhat of a reboot of sorts, the standalone origin tale is impeccable from start to finish and echoes resemblance to the best joker origin comics from the past. Joaquin bleeds, sweats, and cries his every drop into this magnificently dedicated performance. Heath Ledger would be proud. This is undoubtedly the greatest acting performance since Heath's joker. The directing and writing is slickly brilliant and the bleak settings and tones are palpable throughout. When this film was over the place was blown away and every audience member was awestruck that they witnessed a film that could still transport them into a character's world and very existence. Believe the hype. This is going to be revered as a transcending masterpiece of cinema."
10/10,Outstanding movie with a haunting performance and best character development ever seen,MihaVrhunc,10/3/2019,"Every once in a while a movie comes, that truly makes an impact. Joaquin's performance and scenography in all it's brilliance. Grotesque, haunting and cringy. Hard to watch at times,... but so mesmerizing, you won't blink an eye watching it. Tragic, but with seriously funny moments. Emotional rollercoaster - sometimes, with multiple emotions popping-up at the same time.this is far from a typical action-riddled predictable super-hero movie - it's a proper psychological thriller/drama, with the single best character development I have ever seen."
10/10,The Hype is real,kdagoulis26,10/4/2019,"Most of the time movies are anticipated like this they end up falling short, way short. Joker is the first time I was more than happy with the hype. Please ignore the complaints of ""pernicious violence"" as they are embarrassing to say the least. We haven't seen a comic movie this real before. If we ever ""deserved"" a better class of criminal - Phillips and Phoenix have delivered. This is dark, Joker IS dark and you will fall in love with the villain as you should. The bad guys are always more romantic anyway."
10/10,Only certain people can relate,lesterarnoldpinto,10/7/2019,"This is a movie that only those who have felt alone and isolated can truly relate to it. You understand the motive and you feel sorry for the character. A lot of people will see this movie and think that it encourages violence. But truly, this movie should encourage each and every one of us to become a better person, treat everyone with respect and make each other feel like they belong in this world, instead of making them feel isolated."
10/10,"Must have put a SMILE of Satisfaction on Heath Ledger's Face, right in the Heaven!",Chandler_Bing_,9/1/2019,"Truly a masterpiece, The Best film of 2019, one of the Best films of the decade... And TRULY the Best film to bring a comic book so chillingly and realistically to real ife.Remarkable Direction, Cinematography, Music and the Acting.I don't understand why critics are surprised to find it DISTURBING and VIOLENT, when the title character is infamous for it and fans were already rooting for this.OSCARS are on their way!"
10/10,MASTERPIECE 😍,logical_guy,9/1/2019,"Joaquin Phoenix gives a tour de force performance, fearless and stunning in its emotional depth and physicality. It's impossible to talk about this without referencing Heath Ledger's Oscar-winning performance from The Dark Knight, widely considered the definitive live-action portrayal of the Joker, so let's talk about it. The fact is, everyone is going to be stunned by what Phoenix accomplishes, because it's what many thought impossible - a portrayal that matches and potentially exceeds that of The Dark Knight's Clown Prince of Crime"
10/10,JUST AMAZING. How does this movie exist.,VallejoDiego,10/4/2019,"Let me start off by saying if Joaquin Phoneix doesn't get his Oscar for this movie. Then the Oscars should be cancelled. Phoneix is amazing as you might've heard from every review ever! But Todd Phillips. Is at his best here. The story lines he takes and visuals are just breathtaking. The score!! Omg the Score! Every time that score came on, I felt very uncomfortable, like something horrible was about to happen. It was GREAT. The Inspirations from Taxi Driver and King of Comedy are there, and add so much for the movie. And I got to be honest. There are scenes that are very violent. And its disturbing. But I honestly expected it to be WAYYYY more violent from all the controversy going on. Overall this movie was GREAT. Come Oscar season, it needs to be nominated for Best Picture, ScreenPlay, Cinematography, Actor, Score and Director"
10/10,Went for a second time to watch,mariamelkott,10/3/2019,"I get why some people hate this . It's because of the political message and how some people think that you need get empathy for Arthur's madness. But come on that is not the point and it will never be. Enjoy this masterpiece because Joaquin Phoenix and Todd Phillips overdid themselves with this movie . The acting,music and cinematography are just amazing ! Please enjoy the movie without overthinking it."
10/10,"A psychological study, rather than a superhero flick",t-viktor212,9/1/2019,"I have seen Joker yesterday at Venice an early ill-fated screening. We had some trouble with audio that lead to a near-hour delay, but it definitely was worth it.Joker deserved to be presented at Venice Film Festival, an event that regards cinema as a form of art, because this film is far from a blockbuster or a mere entertainer movie, as most films in the genre are.It focuses on the psyche of the main character, as it slowly crumbles under the pressure of society. And thus, Joaquin Phoenix does a wonderful performance, earning almost surely a nomination at the oscars at least.It's a take on the Joker that differs from Ledger's, but I'd say that both are equally as good. The main difference might be that Ledger's joker is a rational that acts insane, while Phoenix's is insane to the root.Despite being a movie about a superhero villain, Joker is much superior to most of the movies of the genre (I'd exclude the Dark Knight Trilogy only, but Joker is easily as good as Nolan's movies, or at least very close). It is a small-scaled film, with a distinct style and cinematography (that cannot but be appreciated) and a set of very cinephile references that however do not feel too forced or overly opressive. (most notable are the similarities to Scorsese's 'Taxi Driver' and his 'The King of Comedy', but also Chaplin's 'Modern Times' is somewhat referenced).I am eager to see more non-comedic efforts by Todd Phillips. This movie was so far probably the best of 2019 (at worst contested so far only by Dolor Y Gloria or Once Upon a Time in Hollywood), and that should be very convincing."
10/10,"Joaquin 'OSCAR', Joker = best Dark suspense thriller ... Darker than dark Knight.",johnnash-18420,9/1/2019,"It's sad that Joaquin missed Oscar for 'The gladiator' as he was very compelling Villain. But I am quite confident he will win it for the 'Joker'. Damn what a movie !!! Keeps u on the toes all the time. Unpredictable storyline and really a deep interesting plot. Did I forget to mention acting ? Damn Do niro and Joaquin teach u what really is 5 star acting.To enjoy this movie, get a wine in your hand, close the curtains, turn of ur cellphones and put do not disturb sign on ur door. Best Dark thriller suspense movie you will get to experience."
10/10,Good lord,link9933,10/6/2019,"The acting, cinematography, sound design, and the script itself is phenomenal. This movie is a triumph. Joaquin Pheonix deserves an Oscar win for this tbh."
10/10,"Finally, a REAL movie",davestroud-76036,10/4/2019,"This movie causes the audience to consider many topics on morality, particularly the poor choices made by the Joker. The Joker is more relatable in this movie than antagonists usually are. I think this gives a more realistic view of ""bad"" people, who are not usually 100% bad in all ways as society often judges. It is important to know when to sympathize with the Joker (towards the beginning of the movie), and when he needs to be identified as a threat (when he begins making certain bad choices). This movie is only suitable for adults who are willing to pick it apart and think critically about it. It isn't for light amusement. That substance is what makes it so good.If you aren't able to ponder underlying themes on your own, and you have to be handed all your thoughts to you, then this isn't the best movie for you."
9/10,Not a spoon feeding of CGI fueled faux drama.,brianmlucas,10/5/2019,"The movie affects you in a way that makes it physically painful to experience, but in a good way."
10/10,Critics are useless!,jennifer_camp28,10/6/2019,"I quit relying on critic reviews years ago... I noticed for this movie that the critics ratings were low but viewer ratings were high. That being said, what is the point of a critic when for this movie, they are oh so wrong.I went and saw this tonite with my mom. I went in skeptical and w some what low expectations. I knew not to expect your typical super hero movie.What we got was a masterpiece. I went in expecting sheer boredom and I was instead on the edge of my seat the whole time. Not action edge of your seat, it was a fear of what he may do or say next edge of your seat. To see this character evolve into what we all know as the #1 villain of Batman was beyond genius and Joaquin Phoenix is a true master at perfecting the art of consuming himself into this character. I may be all over the place with this but I don't care. This movie, the story, the acting, directing, effects, everyone brought their A game and JP definitely deserves a nod and win for this role. And no, there is no comparison here to Jack Nicholson or Heath Ledger. Each actor took on this character and different levels, different story points and different points in time, so any comparison would just not be feasible or fair to any of the actors as they embraced him and made him come to life in their own genius way!"
10/10,Oscar for Phoenix,issrafeel,10/3/2019,I will stop watching movies if Joaquin Phoenix is not awarded Oscar for his tremendous acting.
10/10,Joker > Endgame,burkholdermicah,9/2/2019,"Need I say more? Everything about this Movie is Masterful in every single way! Joker isn't just an awesome comic book movie, it's an awesome movie, period. It offers no easy answers to the unsettling questions it raises about a cruel society in decline. Joaquin Phoenix's fully committed performance and Todd Phillips' masterful albeit loose reinvention of the DC source material make Joker a film that should leave comic book fans and non-fans alike disturbed and moved in all the right ways."
10/10,The Rise of the Joker!,ahmetkozan,11/13/2019,"Joaquin' portrayal of a sociopathic, mentally unstable man's transformation to the iconic Joker was non other than a grippingly accurate, realistic and touching rendition. A dark and disturbing character piece led by an Oscar worthy performance by Joaquin Phoenix. You really do feel bad for this guy, which makes it all the more heartbreaking when he inevitably becomes the clown prince of crime we all know and love, although we've never seen him like this. We see him suffer throughout the movie to the point we're almost rooting for himk to become a mass murdering psyco clown, because that at least will make feel better; then it happens and we just wish this could have all just been avoided, because es so messed up. We feel for him and care about him. By the time he's the joker, we wish we could've helped him. There's a lot of great nods to the greater Batman universe, yet the movie is a self contained character piece. That can only be the mark of a great movie. All the acting is great, the plot (while similar to Taxi Driver) is brilliant and the quality of the movie shows you don't need CGI super powers to be a great villain in a Superhero movie. Is a joke not everyone gets. This movie is ""the rise of the Joker!"" 10/10"
9/10,Don't (forget to) smile.,Aaron_Kyle,12/1/2019,"Joker is directed by Todd Philips and stars Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck, a man disregarded and thrown out of society.We live in an era in which formulaic comic book movies are more and more common. Joker not only proves that you can make a comic book movie without a villain but also proves that comic book movies can be used as psychological studies reflecting on how our society views and treats mental health issues of certain individuals.If I had to describe Joaquin Phoenix as the Joker in one word it would be mesmerising. His take on the iconic comic book character is filled with emotional depth to the point where it's almost painful to watch and flawlessly realistic making it one of the best performances of the decade.The cinematography is also something to note. It is full of gorgeous shots with a beautiful colour palate making it's shot composition and structure heavily differ from most comic book films.The score is very minimalistic but every time it comes on it feels unsettling and haunting which adds to the suspense of the story.My biggest and only issue with Joker is that it's too inspired by Scorsese's King of Comedy and Taxi Driver making the majority of the film predictable. However, making it predictable didn't take away much from its quality and only made it more unsettling because we can see the degradation of Joker's mind before it happens making the film more depressing.I wouldn't really call Joker a comic book movie. Yes, it's based on a comic book and depicts arguably the most iconic comic book character of all time, but it stands alone among dozens of its predecessors as a psychological drama that reflects on society and its issues rather than a fantasy world.Overall, Joker is a brilliant take on the character, however it's not for the faint of heart or narrow-minded and prejudiced people.Final Grade - 9/10"
10/10,BELIEVE THE HYPE,j_bone-43816,10/4/2019,"Joaquin Phoenix gives Heath Ledger a run for his money, true story. This is not a popcorn fluff comic book flick. DO NOT TAKE YOUR KIDS TO SEE THIS MOVIE. Shut down all ballots for the Oscar, Joaquin is taking that one home hands down. One of the best origin stories EVER put out. The only downside to this movie, is that it is a stand alone film that will have no sequels or ties to the DC Universe. Todd Philips take on the Joker is one of pure brilliance and Joaquin Phoenix was the Joker we deserved. He didn't steal from Jack or Heath but yet you got a taste of both."
10/10,Masterpiece.,ahakimshashaa,10/3/2019,"The music. The intense. The realism. The performance. The story. Such a perfect combination of everything. I never felt that a character like joker could be real until I saw this. Phoenix shows us what a joker is in our society and shows us how power can be obtained. Philips on the other hand had the perfect choice of music, camera angles, lighting and every important factor. Overall, I did not expect the story to be this perfect. Too many shocking turns happened and it really does represent today's society. If I was in the first screening, I would have applauded for 80 min not 8."
10/10,You wouldn't get it,nerdgasms,11/30/2019,This was amazing. DC needs to stick with the serious and more realistic stuff. I haven't seen a DC movie this good since the Nolan Dark Knight films. This was a surprising place to find a realistic take on mental health issues and I was not expecting to ever feel bad for the Joker. The fact that some of the media doesn't get this movie is kinda ironic isn't it? It's almost like they want something negative to occur so they can blame it on the movie instead of looking in the mirror.
10/10,2nd time and still amazing......,kasper-rieck,11/20/2019,"Saw Joker for the second time in a cinema to night, and I was still both entertained and amazed over this masterpiece......One of the best films for many years and just might the best performance by a leading actor since Taxidriver and still maybe even better....Joaquin must win the Oscar for that performance.... I was blown away by his portrail of Joker.Go see it for the first, second or maybe eight time👍😊"
10/10,A masterpiece of our time,abhinav-prkash,11/18/2019,A masterpiece of our time
10/10,Brilliant. And best joker I've ever seen,colimexadrian,10/4/2019,"Phoenix convinces me that he has always meant to be the joker. The movie went beyond my expectations, so many emotions went through me these couple hours. I think because its rated R, Phoenix was able to unlock jokers full psychotic potential as the character he is meant to be. This was an AMAZING story, and it calls for more. And I mean a build up, a second movie, maybe one with batman? My hopes are too high at this point, but nevertheless, brilliant goddamn movie and THE BEST joker ever played hands down."
10/10,Requiem of a broken man,andymaranam,10/1/2019,"The perfect portrait of a decline to insanity""& Joaquin Phoenix portrays this flawlessly in a performance of a lifetime.Choreographed impeccably by Todd Phillips & is nothing short of breathtaking.The cinematography & backdrop ideology of such an original film for such a complex character is only complimented by the superb soundtrack & acting. A hauntingly beautiful film & A Definate 10/10.Edit: Bring on part 2 plssssss!. We all want it!."
10/10,Movie of the Decade,diorboeyoung,10/4/2019,"The pool does not need the money. They need the dignity and respect, coz that is what it takes to be a human. If you don't have that, money will only be a reminder of them being a ""good boy"". Like some politicians, they feel so frustrated when people from the lower class does not accept their funding champions. In this movie, through joker's life, I begin to get it."
10/10,Anyone who rates this movie poorly clearly doesn't appreciate cinema,fitchbuster,10/9/2019,"While the trailers for this movie have may seemed like there was potential for an action packed movie, this movie, clearly before it came to theaters was intended to be a progressive character study. You shouldn't go into this movie expecting intense action or the joker we know of the past. This is a movie about how Arthur Fleck becomes the Joker.I have seen so many bad reviews about how boring or slow the movie is, but I believe it was utter perfection. The first part of the movie we begin to understand Arthur as a person. All of his interactions with everyone in his life, be it good or bad. The whole point of a character study is evolution. And this is far and away one of the greatest evolutions of a character I have ever seen in a movie.Joaquin Phoenix's performance is by far the best acting I have seen in a movie possibly in the last few decades. We see a challenged person be challenged by society and it completely breaks him down over time. And Joaquin isn't acting, he is evolving all throughout the movie. If anyone thinks he doesn't put on an Oscar winning performance, they're out of their effing mind. Yes, the movie is slow to start, but it has to be. We couldn't just jump into the joker and all the chaos. We need to know where it came from to begin with.The whole compilation of the movie is amazing. The complete Oscar deserving performance of Joaquin, the choreography, the cinematography, the score. Everything is in perfect harmony. While there may have been a lot of controversy surrounding this movie, the team put together a perfect movie and I pity those who can't appreciate the tears and sweat and emotion that went into making this movie.I have always been so one sided in my movie preferences between Marvel and DC. I feel like Marvel is sooo much better overall and most movies DC puts out are trash. But Joker is far and away my favorite comic movie. Even though it takes a completely different spin on comic movies. You have to appreciate the evolution to appreciate this movie. It's not an action movie, but it's really rips and tears at all the emotions in one movie while adding a wild suspenseful kick. No other comic book movie has done that before."
9/10,Probably one of the best comic book movies out there with a performance of Phoenix that will make you speechless at the end #Venice76,dmehic,9/4/2019,Probably one of the best comic book movies out there with a performance of Phoenix that will make you speechless at the end #Venice76
10/10,CLOWN PRINCE OF CRIME has arrived,prasadraokodasu,9/1/2019,"10/10 Amazing story, Brilliant taking, magnificent cinematography.Someone had to step out of the safe game played by Superhero movies and Joker movie does just that (also The Boys). Movie is gritty, real, insanely dark and sometime quite disturbing to people who don't want accept what's shown in the movie is a terrible reality we face everyday if refused a proper care.Normally people start to compare the movie with one of the greatest like The Dark Knight and in acting wise to that of Heath ledger's Potrayal of joker.I wouldn't say this movie is better that that or otherwise , but it will stand tall amongst the greatest like The Godfather, Taxi Driver, Citizen Kane, The Dark Knight.Coming to the inevitable comparison of who's the better Joker? Heath or Joaquin. The answer is Both did a phenomenal job and the Joker character itself is fortunate to have being played by two greatest actors.Definitely a top contender for Oscars. I personally think it would take away1.Best Actor 2.Cinematography 3.Original score and if Once Upon a time in Hollywood loses in Make-up and hairstyling category it would definitely be to The Joker."
10/10,Best DC movie since The Dark Knight Rises,NpMoviez,10/15/2019,"DC can STILL give us a compelling movie. Wasn't quite hyped about it, I mean, an origin story of a villain made by the director of Hangover movies; what could I even expect? Then, the reviews started to drop. Still wasn't sure if I would like it. And after I saw it, it was way better than I thought it would be. I won't call it a masterpiece, but it definitely is on my top 3 DC films of all times!Good : There's hardly anything bad about Joker. Joaquin Phoenix does a great job of bringing the character into life. Rather than a typical superhero/supervillain origin story, we get to see a psychological drama + horror, and thank God, we got that. I love the genre, I love films like Infinity War, Days of Future Past, Endgame and Raimi's Spider-Man. But occasionally, it's really good to take a break from such films. It's, kind of, in the category of films like Unbreakable. Basically, the movie is (no spoilers ahead) Arthur, being tormented by the society and being a mentally unstable loner, loses his mind after the constant torment and after that, all hell breaks loose. That's all the movie shows. It would be quite difficult to give a really good story for a plot like this, since there are many movies with this kind of plot (awfully crappy ones included). I completely liked this movie, means the screenplay and direction worked for me. You can feel for Arthur, whenever the movie asks you to. You want to root for Arthur, but you know that it will mean some incredibly terrible things will happen. We see him slowly transition into Joker, and when he completely turns into the Joker it is worth a round of applause. We feel good as well as terrified with the actions of the Joker whenever he snaps and crazy stuff happens. Without getting into spoilers, I would say - in short - that it has many quotable lines and each of them make sense. Whatever Joker (a psychopath) says is more realistic than what a sane person says. And obviously has some sick, terrifying and gruesome Joker moments that a proper Joker movie should have. If it's not clear by the trailers, there's no Batman here. But (again, no spoilers) it does have some Batman references to support the movie. It could've created a mess and might have felt like a shoehorned plotline, but it plays out as a proper support for the main story and the transition of Arthur into Joker.Mixed : It is a good thing that the movie has a 70s psycho horror vibe to it. But, it could've been more original. Like many others have pointed out, it's similar to Taxi Driver by Scorsese. While it wasn't a copy and paste of Taxi Driver, but some parts make it obvious that the movie was inspired by Taxi Driver. Not necessarily a bad thing, the movie has the elements as a homage-ish way, but looking at how well made it was, it could've been slightly more original. And, it may feel a bit slow for some people, though it's worth your time.My take on the controversy : It can happen that some morons might watch this film and cause violence. It can happen with any violent movie. But, even though it justified the Joker's actions, it doesn't show them to be right. Speaking of violence, it's just psychologically compelling horror. It's less violent than Deadpool, but feels more violent as it's a serious movie. So, glorification and siding with a psychopath is a complete and total nonsense.Conclusion : It's a must watch. You don't need to follow any of the DC movies to understand it. But do not expect it to be a typical superhero action film with CGI battles and a spectacle. Wrong expectations might ruin the experience. Else, I found it to be better than The Dark Knight Rises. And TDKR is one of my favorites in the genre. If a Nolan movie is replaced by another movie in my list, you may consider it to be great. One last thing, people causing violence because of Joker would be equivalent to The Good, The Bad and The Ugly inspiring three people to have a gun duel for some gold.Rating:Score : 10/10Grade : A+"
9/10,Saw it tonight and had to make an account so I can tell everyone how good it is,noahbarber-35968,10/4/2019,"Seriously, unbelievable. Dare I say better than Heath Ledger? If Joaquin Phoenix doesn't win the Oscar for best actor and 'Joker' doesn't win at the VERY least, best screenplay, it will be one of the biggest Oscar snubs of our time"
10/10,Cinematic Masterpiece,ashleighjwood,10/4/2019,I read reviews before watching the film and was not disappointed! Joquain's performance..... the cinematography..... the fact that it was relatable in regards to mental illness.... it was all-consuming and I was enthralled the entire time! I'll be going back to see this again in the next few days and I NEVER do that!
7/10,Between a 7 and an 8,romanwatson,10/6/2019,"I thought this film was good but I just don't get the hype personally. The acting was amazing and the film was good overall but I think 'masterpiece' and 'film of the year' are a bit overused throughout the reviews. In no way did I dislike this film, I thought it was really good, just overhyped. I feel as though a lot of the 10/10 reviews are purely based on the fact that it already has amazing reviews and so people want to carry the praise further and that it is about the joker. If this film was released and was about some random guy in the same situation, I don't think the reviews would be as high but maybe that's the point."
10/10,THIS IS HOW A DC MOVIE SHOULD BE!,lilfin007,10/9/2019,"This movie is a masterpiece! It absolutely epitomizes what a DC movie should be. Dark, emotional, thought provoking, not just action action action. One of the best movies I've seen in a long time.Critics have definitely lost touch with the public and should be ignored on this one. Do yourself a favor and watch it!And remember to be good to one another. You dont know what someone else is going through."
10/10,Astonishing Masterpiece,Sinbaddylad,10/4/2019,"What an incredible ride this was. I was almost motionless throughout, watching in awe the performance of a lifetime - the transition from troubled man to monster, the hounding score which directly drove the goosebumps, the cinematography which made you feel like you were flying through Gotham looking for Arthur yourself and the masterful De Niro who gave his nod to Jerry Lewis. Ignore DC. Ignore Batman. This is a work of art in its own right."

10/10,BEST MOVIE OF THE YEAR,danieldx-47989,10/8/2019,"The movie was excellent and amazing, from the beginning that Joaquin's personality is seen as he evolves in the Joker until the end, Joker is the most difficult character to do and I think Joaquin did it!!"
10/10,First time writing a review... that's how good this is,pztc,10/6/2019,"Please go watch this movie! This is the first time I've ever wrote a review on this app and I've been using it to read reviews for years! That's how good this film is. Very dark, grimy and disturbing, exactly how an origin film about the joker should be. I have no doubt it will win multiple oscars. Do yourself a favor and go see it!!!"
10/10,Stop comparing it with Endgame,mrunalshikharerocks,10/3/2019,"Joker is literally an achievement in cinematic history there's no doubt in that ! But why people comparing it with Endgame ? Both movies have their own ways and they are completely different. Endgame was the best at its genre. Talking about Joker ... What can I say ... A beautiful presentation of storyline , direction , screenplay was all at its peak of greatness ... Heath ledger smiling down to earth :)"
10/10,Oscar Sooner or later,mamadneziiii,10/4/2019,"W.O.W!!!What can I say about how brilliant Phoenix act performance is ??In shortcut,movie of the year 💯/💯👏"
6/10,Is it great? I don't know.,ernestoherreraf,10/25/2019,"When I heard everyone saying that this is the film of the year and all the reviews flooding in with 10's, I was quite hyped and excited for this movie. When I walked out of the cinema, I felt hollow and empty.Before I continue writing, let me say this, This is NOT the film of the year nor is it a real masterpiece. The cinematography is excellent and the acting is incredible, that's just it. The side-characters are bland and overly dramatic. The plot heavily relies on plot-twists and the film is so harsh that it actually falls flat on it's face.Are there no good points though? Phoenix is phenomenal and the score is great. The cinematography is also incredible but the plot is not that great at all. It even has plot holes and scenes that left me empty.Film of the year? Nope."
10/10,The best thing DC has done since Dark Knight,hcalvt11,10/5/2019,"Joker is without a doubt my new favorite DC film. It's dark and gritty but with enough psychological twists that it keeps you guessing from beginning to end. Nothing can be taken at face value and the film forces you to think from beginning to end. Don't listen to the critics, this one is worth watching multiple times in theaters."
6/10,Extremely overrated,coxlchris,10/23/2019,"I went into this film expecting an all-time classic based on the reviews I had read & what I ended up watching was just a decent film overall. Phoenix is outstanding...so he definitely did his part. But I feel like if you've seen the trailers you've seen the movie because the best way I can describe this film is it feels like a 2 hour version of the trailer. At 2 hours it's a relatively common runtime, but it felt a lot longer...which isn't good. I'd say this is much more of a rental than a theater movie. Kinda just....eh."

10/10,Mesmerizing,pankajshukla-58226,9/1/2019,The ending is what matters in a movie. And this movie has a kind of ending which would leave many speechless. It's indeed a masterpiece:)
10/10,Clear the Shelf for the Oscars,davidgibson-19224,10/9/2019,"I am not a Batman fan nor am I particularly fond of Joaquin Phoenix, but this movie was truly exceptional. It started slow but built to a viscerally satisfying crescendo. I never thought I would be rooting for the Joker, but found that I did so throughout the movie. The Joker's pain was so palpable. I am filling out my Oscar pool card right now.PS This movie is dark and violent and decidedly not a super hero movie. Leave the kids at home."
10/10,Perfect,alshehhi-94809,9/1/2019,Creative actor Joaquin creativity embodied the role of the Joker film deserves more than 10
10/10,Masterpiece,jegorstepanow,10/4/2019,"Yesterday was that day, when I understand, that I have touched history. This movie will drag you in your deepest thoughts, in your darkest secrets and suffering. This masterpiece will grind you, like a meat grinder and you will watch it in silence and with open mouth. Like the whole cinema will.I don't like comics movie, marvel is very pompous, absurd and insipid. In my opinion. It's not an art, it's just an attraction. As DC movies was too. But now DC made history, the made art and made drama.To be more understandable. When you watch for example Avengers or League of Justice you are eating McDonald's hamburger. But when you watch Joker you are eating 1000$ stake in the most luxurious restaurant in the world."
6/10,OMG - Am I getting old or are people getting more stupid,baddddboi,11/2/2019,"I was so hyped up to see this movie, loved the trailer, only movie I have wanted to watch in the cinema for a very long time.I watched it and was bored. the astectics were amazing, music was good, story and execution was meh. the performence of the joker was a good performence but people raving about this are driving me mad. either you have not seen many movies or I have seen too many. this movie was bang average and was actually boring. I was thinking about leaving half way through as I was bored out of my mind.I do not regret watching it but it is being so overhyped that I am so confused right now. I think it had a good premise but could have been so much more, so much more.Signs of a great movie is the repeat viewing of it or it moving you, did not move me whatsoever and I would not watch it again.I thought maybe people are getting paid to write good review but have actually met people who think it is the best movie ever.... OMGGGThis movie is bang average and way overhyped.phenoix performence is good but as the story and execution is so bad, I feel he never even touched the higher spectrums of performence.I have experienced and seen worse in my life, if this made you feel, you are (i hate this word but have to use it) a snowflake. Please get off social media and live life.there is a real world out there."
10/10,"I liked him before, but this is the 1st time I truly loved a Joker!",Johnny-Dy,11/30/2019,"Nothing short of what I expected. Hands down the best psychological drama ever made, as best as I recall seeing. I never thought that The Joker could be the hero, that would pretty much make everyone else the villains, but it does happen! He does it! Monumental performance by Joaquin Phoenix.Honestly I thought the script would be brilliant, but it's just about good enough, he makes it seem brilliant! Or maybe JP just embodies perfectly the vision of the screenplay writer, and they're both equally good! I've seen it in something akin HDrip and enjoyed every moment of this movie and I await the Blu Ray release so I can enjoy it again, in more detail!The only way you wouldn't like this movie is if you'd be too much of a child or too stupid for it, as it has the most substance a movie can have, by a fu*king continental drift from the lot! It may be my favorite movie ever, but I have to see it a few more times to be certain! I give it good chances though, I liked him before, but this is the 1st time I truly loved a Joker!"
10/10,A legend,mitidariush,11/29/2019,Joaquin Phoenix is a good actor but I think now he become a legend.A nice movie with a great act of a great actor.An unforgettable movie.

10/10,Took my 65 year old mother to see it.,uniquefx,10/13/2019,"I saw the movie after the opening weekend and loved it. I think it's a masterpiece. Convinced my 65 year old mother too see it, who couldn't even remember whose nemesis the Joker is. She had read about all the negative press about the movie being too violent and taking light of mental health issues.She loved the movie. Sympathized for Arthur and was rooting for the Joker (to a certain point) She was surprised about the small amount of violence is depicted after all the press putdown and enjoyed the ""social commentary"" the movie conveys.Her score: 9 / 10Mom is always right."
10/10,Amazing movie,jasimnaeem-09465,9/1/2019,Best acting and story. This is an Oscar winning movie
10/10,"By far the best DC movie to date, Joaquin Phoenix was perfect.",jjhermans-90735,10/4/2019,"Wow, what a movie! I have to admit, When I first heard Joaquin Phoenix was going to be the joker, I was surprised. I wasn't sure how he was going to pull it off. I was hoping it wasn't going to be another cheesy rendition full of fluff and unrealistic explanations of how the Joker came to be. One where my (adult) son wouldn't have to keep nudging me to wake me up. I was pleasantly surprised on well Todd Phillips' version played and Joaquin's acting was superb. You could feel the anguish his character was going through right up to the point he lost his mind. Just an excellent, well acted movie that you almost forget is derived from a DC comic."
10/10,"Spectacular, awesome, fantastic",mr-faool,9/1/2019,"The reality, far from fiction!! That what's made the movie,,, the oscar winner actor made a new joker rivalry with heath ledger joker, better joker in some people opinion.. piece of art"
7/10,Kind of a letdown....,DJRMewzique,10/5/2019,"The reviews here are making this film out to be far better than it actually is. Don't get me wrong, technically, it is extremely well done and Phoenix's performance is really quite extraordinary (he is definitely looking at an Oscar nomination), but despite excellent writing, acting and direction........the film is kinda boring.It had its moments, and, sure, it has some very disturbing elements but....If I had a watch, I would have looked at it many times as what this film lacks is...excitement.The final act is most excellent, but it felt like it took forever to get to it."
9/10,DARK AND DEPRESSING.,andrewchristianjr,10/4/2019,"Dark, depressing and unsettling film with a haunting score. Incredible acting, directing and screenplay. Joaquin killed it. 5 out of 5 stars! Mental health is so important guys!!!"
10/10,Masterpiece *Movie Of the Year* Best Actor - Joaquin Phoenix*,wongcalvin,10/2/2019,"Wow I honestly gotta tell you, it's one of the best movies I've seen in years. All from the cinematography, thumping and sadden soundtrack, all the way to the OMG performance by Joaquin Phoenix, it's dark, it's evolving, twisting and wow just you can feel deep down to your bones his emotions portraying the Joker.Just alone watching hearing The Jokers laugh is so twisty and evil and you could hear his sadness coming out from his mouth. You could hear the hours of practice just on the laugh alone and his method acting is perfectly on point along with his subtle gestures and dance that is done perfectly as the Joker should be. This movie has all the psychological twisting that made you believed and immersed into the movie, I was totally shocked and overwhelmed by everything even after I left the cinema. Just mind-blowned.When I was watching in just now in the cinema, more than half the cinema cheered and applauded on certain scenes. And almost the entire patron stayed until the last credit. If u looked closely even Joker costume were evolving and changing from time to time based on his journey and experienced and just looked at the final and true form just looked absolutely stunning. Just the excitement and the dialogues told by The Joker is just so heart-crushing and it just made me felt so bad for the Joker, and it's the first time where I sided with the evil character or maybe he is the hero of this movie, who knows ?Honestly, u have to watch it, it's one of the best performance u be watching in a Long time, movies like this deserves to be watched on the Big Screen, go find the best cinema in town and enjoy the wild ride of emotions and fear and anger, just satisfying!!"

10/10,Masterpiece!,zyalahmad-35308,10/4/2019,JOKER is a gift to the audiences. I felt as a privileged person to sit in a movie theater and watching it. Joaquin Phoenix and Todd Phillips gave to the world of cinema a rear pearl. I don't know what people are complaining about: this is really something else.

10/10,¡absolutely incredible!,joaquinr-64300,10/6/2019,"I can't believe that such a totally perfect and spectacular movie I just saw, I am completely stunned. This movie needs to be in the Oscars. Nominated to:This film must be nominated for the following awards:Best moviebest ActorBest screenplayBest addressBest Adapted ScreenplayBest soundtrackBest sound mixing"
10/10,Hats off to Joaquin phoenix,Hmnsu1994,9/3/2019,What a legendary character and what a legendary performance by the actor. I was not able to move on from the Heath ledger performance but this movie is totally worth it. This movie deserves an oscar. It showcased the never before seen origin of The Joker himself and you will love it.
8/10,Uncomfortably Satisfying,kazarlengo-299-754799,10/4/2019,"To say it was satisfying would be somewhat misleading. Joaquin Phoenix makes you feel uncomfortable almost the entire time. I couldn't help thinking about Christian Bale in The Machinist and Robert De Niro in Taxi Driver. With those comparisons, clearly I have some high praise on the acting.The film itself slowly builds momentum, but when it builds...it's really builds. Those looking for traditional comic book action may feel it moves a bit slow, but it's pace allows for the transformation to not feel superficial. When you walk out of the theater you won't know exactly how to feel, but you'll surely want to know how everyone else feels about it."

3/10,Miserable and Unpleasant Slog of a Movie about Nothing,michaelmcdonald-20730,10/4/2019,"BREAKING NEWS: Killer clowns are back! But this time they're not pranksters mimicking Pennywise to scare the sh*t out of people for viral memes; they're ""incels"" threatening to gun down everyone who chooses to take their date to this dour, depressing, demented movie.If this Joker were the one featured in Nolan's marvelously entertaining Dark Knight, I doubt any of your skinny lonely drugged-up psychos would be rushing to hail this guy as his hero and inspiration.Ledger's Joker is brilliant, manipulaitve, and consumed with an infectious, and sometimes charming, confidence. Phoenix's Joker is dumb, depressing, and insecure. Ledger makes things happen. Things happen to Phoenix. The Joker controls events in Dark Knight. Events spiral out of control in Joker.There is no fun in this movie, no great action set pieces, no hint of hope or optimism. It's a two hour slog of watching a miserable man drive himself insane until he starts murdering people. Then seemingly everyone goes insane because ""they've had enough!""Change the name of this movie to Arthur, eliminate the very few references to the Batman universe, and I doubt you'd think this was an origin story to the Joker we all know and love. Maybe this Joker is the closest to what the Joker would resemble in the real world...which is perhaps why this movie is so awful. Who wants that movie?There are plenty of good character-driven films of mentally disturbed individuals who spiral out of control. There are plenty of good dark gritty super hero movies. This is neither of them."
10/10,One of THE BEST PERFORMANCE ever!,tukrography,10/4/2019,"Wow, it takes a while to find the right words to describe this movie. It's different! It feels like a character study, almost like a documentary but at the same time as if you'd be watching a horror drama movie as intense as it is and realistic.It touches on mental health issues which sadly this country is struggling with but won't admit to it. This film has the best character development I could possibly think of! Now I will say this:JOKER is the last movie you'd ever want to show to kids! Not even teenagers should see this! It might be a tough one for them to see as it is brutal, bloody and might even be simply too much to handle. I saw some walk out of the theater and if you're a very sensitive person you might do the same! However, it is by far the best film and performance of the year and there's no doubt Joaquin Phoenix should win all awards for this including the Oscar! And in my opinion while it is a different take on the JOKER, this is the best portrayal of the JOKER.Go see this with an open mind, and if possibly without expectations. This will definitely spark many conversations and most likely arguments as well."
3/10,I made an account just to rate my disappoint for this film.,jabberwacky-01459,10/17/2019,"I was expecting a masterpiece and oscar worthy film from all the hype.I actually didn't enjoy watching this movie.there was no message, it was slow and the joker turned out just to be the son of a schizophrenic and went crazy over a slight amount of bullying. I don't see how anyone could relate to this character and the laughing is lame acting way overdone.I'm just stunned that this has a 9/10 rating right now, how the hell?"
6/10,Good Film but nothing to do with the Joker,alberto-11467-52640,10/5/2019,"The performance of Joaquin is excellent but the story simply don't have anything to do with the Joker, it's more about a mentaly ill man struggling with his chaotic enviroment until it's overwhelmed and snaps. I would be a much better film if the title was ""Arthur"" or ""The Clown"" but the fact that it's forced to be related to the batman universe it's why i feld it didn't work."
10/10,Cinematic Masterpiece,umghumman,9/1/2019,"Acting, Cinematography, Music, Screenplay, Costumes, Gotham etc everything is 10/10.Oscar worthy performanceby by Joaquin Phoenix.Amazing directing by Todd Phillips & amazing cinematography by Lawrence Sher."
9/10,"A masterclass in acting, sound mixing and cinematography.",cmills-98693,10/7/2019,"Without a doubt, Joker is in contention for the film of the year.With Joachin Phoenix garnering praise left and right for Joker it's easy to dismiss the multiple other elements of direction, sound mixing, editing, cinematography, set and costume design and casting that make this a truly astounding piece of artistic cinema.Joker is a film that without any one of these elements, it would fail. It would slip into the same bracket as Suicide Squad and be forgotten, but, fail it certainly does not.Joachin Phoenix is phenomenal. We know this already from pictures like Her and The Master, what we didn't know was how utterly deep and broad his range was. At points, I was totally absorbed by Joker. For the first time in possibly 10 years the movie theatre melted away, along with other viewers and noises and I was a part of that film. It was as if I was watching a documentary, rather than a fictional work. His commitment to the role, his weight loss and mental strain are dangerous but it produces something that no one ever thought would happen. It produces a performance that could genuinely rival Heath Ledgers.Todd Phillips direction and script are masterstrokes. If it were a painting it would be a Turner, with bright violent skies, and dark sad landscapes. His beautiful melting pot of inspiration features large doses of Martin Scorsese's 'The King of Comedy' and 'Taxi Driver', alongside the physiological battery acid from more recent pictures such as Fight Club and Black Swan.It swirls together to birth this bitter, gritty, dark, mesmerising masterpiece, that both requires and demands, multiple, in-depth viewings.For me, what makes this film is the costume design and the cinematography. The design of every minute detail on each character to make Gotham look even more drab and dull, even more grimy and beaten down is exceptional. Similar to how Scorsese made Harlem and The Bronx look broken and corrupted in Taxi Driver, you feel physically dirty after watching numerous sequences and you feel pangs of genuine social guilt stemming from your own moments of awful selfishness.The cinematography is astounding, and MUST be in contention for an Academy Award, alongside Best Lead, Best Direction and best Sound Mixing. Some of the shots could have been lifted from a Time Magazine piece on 'City Life' they're that artistically powerful. Whole, dialogue-free sequences that say far more with silence and sounds of a city teetering on the brink of oblivion in the background than anyone could ever say. The sound mixing to have conversations, telephones, car horns, shouting, trains prevalent in the background audio leaking into the foreground does what Nolan did in 'Dunkirk' and pushes further the feeling of strain. The idea that even noise is seeping in from the city and soon the barricade will break and it'll drown us all in it's filth, corruption and decadence.Joker is a true masterpiece. So dark, so dirty, so vindictive of a modern flawed and broken societal system, but it always reminds you:Put on a happy face."

3/10,"Over-hyped, overacted with no proper entertainment - The Millennial Joker",victorantiu,10/8/2019,"Absolute disappointment. I believed the hype like a fool. No person that actually saw it told me it was a good movie, just the stupid reviews. It's so cringe, with nothing actually happening except Phoenix smoking and dancing around. There is no action, no substance, no humor. Everything is so cringe and overacted.I suppose if you like those independent movies at TIFF or Cannes this is something for you. If you actually wanna be entertained and see The Joker from the DC, this is not it.Best description is millennial joker. Society is mean to him, nobody gives him anything so he cries and complains about it to get attention. When none is given, he starts killing."
10/10,Chilling and deep,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,10/5/2019,"Arthur(Phoenix, Oscar-worthy yet again) is a clown for hire. He wants to cheer up the world. And to experience human connection. For someone to notice him without becoming verbally, frequently even physically, abusive. To be treated like a person. He struggles with mental illness. Both finding successful treatment, and for others to stop responding so negatively to his diagnosis. And while he feels perpetually lonely, he's not the only one to realize how bad things are getting, and how little those with money and influence do to help anyone but themselves.This is deeply messed up. It makes your mind go places you never thought it would. Including, maybe especially, when funny. In other words, it nails the core, managing to also put a fresh coat of paint on an icon with nearly 80 years of history. This explores how little sympathy and empathy(the lead only loses the audience's once he becomes a monster) is shown towards the least powerful people in society. However, it's not exclusively(albeit chiefly) about those with psychological issues. It also goes into poverty. How little those that could easily address these things even try to properly comprehend the problems. I'm not saying there's a solution that would not require time, political will and accountability for those who use their clout to try to fight these efforts. What I am saying is that we need those I'm talking about to join in the process.Taxi Driver very clearly shaped a lot of this, to incredible effect, and this film is as amazing as that one. This is the first live-action version(at least in the last 30+ years, I will grant that I am not very familiar with the takes that go back further than that) where you can understand how the Joker ends up with his signature look in a realistic world. A vigilante using martial arts and gadgets would have felt hugely out of place in this, so I'm thrilled nothing like that appears(Bruce is a child here), and I hope that this remains standalone, rather than Joaquin facing off against Batman. Keeping in mind that I love The Dark Knight trilogy.I rarely give anything the highest possible score. To me, it means that while the movie isn't perfect(that is a status that should be strived for: it can never truly be reached), there is no weakness within it that is not greatly outweighed by its positives. That's not even a contest when it comes to this. I can't put into words how grateful I am to everyone who worked on this for being able to say that about it.There is some bloody violence in this, a little of it immensely brutal. I recommend this to everyone who is passionate about the titular character. 10/10"
10/10,"Spare me the ""best comic book movie ever"" nonsense.",gatozangado,9/26/2019,"It premiered last night in Sydney and I was lucky enough to watch this masterpiece first hand.The movie is flawless but because of its approach on mental illness and the execution of Joaquin Phoenix. The 80's settings brings a darker filter to it, creating a scenario where you see no hope for a person as the main character to survive.The movie does not praise violence and it's far from being about making the Joker a ""hero"" or him starting a movement, it's all about a man trying to find himself. Violence is what happens in between and labelling the movie as such is a misinterpretation of the picture.Also, if the movie had no reference whatsoever of the Batman universe it would work the same, it is a movie that sustains itself from beginning to end delivering frame by frame what it was meant to."
9/10,Joker's laughter is no joking matter,Davor-Blazevic-1959,10/6/2019,"Writer-director Todd Phillips's new movie ""Joker"" appeals to me on multiple levels, primarily by offering an engaging story, strongly rooted in believable reality, related to audiences mainly by opposing protagonist's prevalent dark depressive moods while using often optimistic soundtrack and sound editing, shallow nonetheless rich visuals, angles and framing, theatricality augmented through expressive costumes, props and sets, but most impressively via great principal performances and acting choices made by Joaquin Phoenix in the lead as a title character (under proper fictional name Arthur Fleck), whose sudden uncontrollable and seemingly inappropriate laughter (justified as a medical condition) easily counterpoints the (painful need for) outcry from Gotham (read: any) City masses, hurt and deprived by injustices of their quotidian existence, as well as by Robert De Niro in a quintessential supporting role of a TV-comedy show host Murray Franklin (both worthy of the end-of-the-year acting award considerations), and by setting believable pre-course for the future adventures of the most realistic DC Comics character, the Batman (not a superhero at all, with his extraordinary capabilities rather resulting from his physical fitness and skills combined with high technology employed), who appears here only as a young boy, and whose later adult activities could be understood as largely driven by what has happened to his parents in the final scene of this movie, an event directly inspired by actions of Joker, henceforth his future main nemeses."

10/10,Disturbingly brilliant film making,ryanphelantv,9/26/2019,"Read all you like about ""Joker"" - there is nothing that will prepare you for the gut-punch to come. This is less ""The Dark Knight"" and more ""Taxi Driver"" but make no mistake, it feels like the most original take you have ever seen on a well-worn genre. It is an uber-violent character study of a mentally ill man trying to survive in a bleak society that is failing him. It is an immersive and cathartic experience, and an enthralling and uncomfortable one for the viewer.If there is a more perfect performance than Joaquin Phoenix commands in this film, I would love to debate it. His depth and range is an acting masterclass and somehow demands empathy in a violent and disturbed character.Todd Phillips stamps himself as a modern master with this film. The look and feel of the film has such pace and menace, yet at the same time creates a claustrophobic atmosphere.It is a brilliant film. I hope people continue to see it as a cinematic masterpiece and it doesn't get caught up in politics or become part of a narrative of the sometimes flawed society we live in ourselves."

3/10,Generous 3.,TheChicagoBears,10/13/2019,"""Joker"" is nor a ""masterpiece"" nor is it ""flawless"" as this board boasts. It's mirely a decent origin, albeit heavy-handed as sin, with choppy flow, poor directing decisions at moments, and part brilliant part wildly overacting on Phoenix's part. The heavy handed nature of mental illness is not written well... It highlghts many different illnesses with none of which feeling whole or handled with much, if any, sense of understanding. Sprinkle in are a few light-hearted moments to remind you that ""hey, he's still funny at times""... But with the strained mental illness angle it's difficult to laugh at these moments without a bit on introspection of what it is and who it is you're laughing at. The real ""danger"" this movie poses is that it's another Hollywood blunder with mental health and its handling... Which does way more harm than good.There is no great existential pandering, ss some are saying... ""it's deep"", ""my feels"", ""It's not a superhero movie it's a character study"", regardless of what anyone wants to categorize it as.. I'll consider it a generous 3."
10/10,The Perfect Storm portrayal of American society,ori-93233,10/11/2019,"A country that makes mental health care treatment unaffordable to the poor (great surprise many of them are...), and blames poor people for being unsuccessful, thereby pushing them to the edges of society. Add to that the second amendment and handing out assault riffles to anyone, and there you have it The Perfect Storm.The most symbolic scene in my opinion is when the Joker puts a gun to his head and we see his face painted in red white and blue...An important movie, that will hopefully emphasize the problem, paving a way for a solution."

2/10,Overacting Galore,cstroeh-848-47606,10/12/2019,"I was underwhelmed - to say it friendly - but not surprised by the fact. Because Hollywood has lost its magic looong time ago. IMHO no. bo. dy gives a damn about Darth Vader's Childhood or Joker's relationship with his mother. All we want for centuries is a proper boogeyman. If you overpaid LaLaLand-Schmocks won't jump from the stupid Prequel-explains-it-all-train - please give us at least solid filmmaking. Joker is a mess. No story, no finesse, no build-up, no surprises, no ideas. But a load of layman-psychology that should make even 12y olds roll their eyes; a cacophony of more or less unrelated scenes; cheesy taxi-driver-moments without any impact; massive overacting by Phoenix and no subtle sinister Joker moments except for the two second Elevator-Scene we all know (and love) from the trailer. rating 9.0? A joke. Heath Ledger, I miss you."
10/10,Amazing movie,kittenimdb,10/4/2019,I'm amazed. I was shocked by how perfect Joaquin's acting was. I never imagined that I'm going too see such a good interpretation of my favorite villain. Thank you for everything!
7/10,Joaquin Phoenix delivers but the story doesn't,danteshamest,10/3/2019,"While I enjoyed the film, it felt pretty short. When ""The End"" appeared on the screen I couldn't help but think - ""That's it?""Joaquin Phoenix was fantastic with his new take on the Joker, and it's mesmerizing to see his facial expressions keep changing. And his Joker laugh is unique - sinister and full of Joker's madness.However despite some minor plot twists, most of interesting bits in the film have already been shown in the trailers. Don't expect much action like in The Dark Knight trilogy. Despite the much hyped gun violence, there are less guns in this movie than in any other Batman flick.This is not a bad film, but it's not a great one either. Watch it only for Joaquin's performance."
10/10,Best Joker ever,ahmad_bac,10/4/2019,That is best joker can i seeAnd joaquin phoenix will win the oscar
3/10,Overrated and badly directed film with a misleading title,chetan420,10/11/2019,"Joker is basically the lite edition or postmodern version of Fight Club or the Scorsese films it lifts from. It's interesting to see how easily words like masterpiece and groundbreaking are being used for this, and that is the one joke that this movie successfully pulls off. It's just a whole lot of self-seriousness and posturing and is essentially hollow. It pretends to say a lot but ends up saying very little or nothing at all, not about the character nor about the society he's part of.It is also 'Joker' only in name and has very little to do with the super-villain. I'm all for a different interpretation and even an origin story for the joker but this movie fails to recognise or capture his spirit. Even 'Proto-Joker' doesn't quite do it justice, and I can think of a dozen more suitable titles e.g. Arthur, The Untalented Mr. Fleck, Smoker, Poser etc. Infact he's more akin to a less dangerous but also mentally unstable villain like Ratcatcher or Calendar Man though just with a clown theme, and is not even close to embodying the joker's extreme form of nihilism. It's not that it has to be a comic-book accurate portrayal, that would be irrelevant if it was genuinely a good movie. But far from being a masterpiece , it doesn't quite manage even that. It fails not just as an inaccurate portrayal of the Joker's spirit or essence, but also as a film about a person going over the edge.The weakest aspect of the movie for me is the poor to average direction. The movie lacks any of the subtlety and nuance that I was hoping for and what unfolds is not as much character development as it is things happening to Arthur. A good example of the poor writing and direction is the very Trump-like and one-dimensional Thomas Wayne character. This first became obvious during a scene in which some people happened to know the entire lyrics to a clown song. In a movie that otherwise tries very hard to be realistic that felt very unnecessary and took me out of the experience and it felt very contrived and predictable after that. It takes too many obvious liberties and plot conveniences to move the story forward in an unnatural and unrefined way, and ultimately felt like they tried to disguise the poor writing and direction with a dark and gritty atmosphere instead of those elements complementing each other.The only reason to watch this movie is Phoenix's performance, which while not groundbreaking is good enough to earn an awards nomination or two. I wouldn't put it in the same league as Heath Ledger's portrayal but they were two very different roles and characters. Ledger made his joker seem effortless while one can really see the strain and work Phoenix puts in. To put it simply, Ledger made it seem natural and didn't look like he was acting while with Phoenix you really know that he is, even to the extent that it may seem like overacting at times. Perhaps owing to the more physical nature of this version of whoever this character is supposed to be, that's not necessarily a criticism.Overall an average film at best that pretends to be a lot more. I don't see this one ageing well or being remembered decades later the way Fight Club or the Scorsese movies it's ""inspired"" by, or CBM's like Dark Knight or Logan or even Tim Burton's Batman, are remembered today."

3/10,"Went into this blind, and i didnt enjoy it at all really. disappointing.",KetamineBen,10/16/2019,"I didnt really know much about this movie. I hadnt seen any trailers for it or anything but i decided to give it a go while i was stoned with my mate Steve. we actually got tickets for a different movie but couldnt find our screen so we ended up in the screen showing The Joker. It wasnt til about 45 minutes in that I realised this movie is no good. I couldnt understand a lot of what certain actors were saying it was really mumbled and low quality. The story is so confusing its hard to keep track of who's who. There's a lot of scenes where literally nothing happens except for people talking or walking down corridors. I whispered to my mate Steve about an hour in to see if he thought it was as bad as i did, but he had fallen asleep.The good thing about the movie is the acting. the geezer who plays the joker is very good at it. Also there is a few very funny scenes near the end but other than that this movie is overly long, too complex, not enough action, and poor directing."
10/10,Can you introduce me as JOKER?,bhernandez2216,9/13/2019,"Critics have just spoken. ""JOKER"" is already the ""#1 Movie in the Whole DC Universe"".

3/10,I don't get what everyone else seems to be seeing.,cjsharkman,10/20/2019,"I do agree that Joaquin's performance was great, very well done and not an easy part to pull off. That however, was the only good part of the film. Movie was dark as I expected, but so much SLOW dialog it was putting me to sleep. Parts of the movie were VERY predictable, though a couple (literally two) of surprises that were good but didn't out weigh a very slow moving poorly laid out story. I say skip this one and wait for it to hit the other subscription services, I'd ask for my money back but I did stay till the end."

While we do sympathize with Arthur, they also show us why we should never take the path he took.... The Joker's path... Every single actor nailed their roles and Joaquin must definitely win the academy this year... We could actually feel and go through his struggle and his pain... Like I said... Words doesn't do it justice... Go watch it... Experience it... And the last act of the film just blows your brain away (spoiler alert!!)"
10/10,"Jaw-dropping film, Joaquin Phoenix ascends to GOAT status",lollo-XD,10/3/2019,"10/10. The direction, the cinematography, the score, the overall acting and tone. This movie would have been great based on that alone, but the protagonist brings something never seen before on stage. I have watched almost everything there is to see, and I had never seen a performance like Phoenix's. Words can't really do it justice. Must watch. Oh and by the way, apparently, it is a comic-book movie. Not that you can tell by watching."
5/10,A decent performance by Joaquin Pheonix sadly let down by a poor and dissapointing script,ITS_SHOWTIME37,10/5/2019,"After seeing the billboard signs all around the London Underground and learning that the critics has approved of the film in their masses, I was very much looking forward to what appeared to be a very different and almost arthouse interpretation of the Joker.Before I tell you what I think of the film, I want to go into what I believe the Joker to be and the interpretation of him based on the comic books. Firstly as per the source material, the Joker is not actually insane but rather what one psychiatrist in the comics describes as being 'supersane'. He sees the irony in the world and the way that it works. Like the Comedian in the Alan Moore comic book 'The Watchmen' (which at one time was going to use the Joker before settling on the Comedian character), he treats the world as 'one big joke'. The Joker does not like to conform or like to follow rules and regulations. In the comic books the Joker is a failed comedian who is driven over the edge after a series of tragedies and then snaps out at the world. This is by no way saying that his actions are ever justified. On the contrary he is evil, ruthless, daring, sadistic and twisted. But not conforming to societies rules and norms makes him far more intelligent and innovative.With that said, I was somewhat dissapointed in the way that the Joker was portrayed in this new movie. Yes, Joaquin Pheonix is a great actor who deserves recognition for his performance here, though I would stop short to suggest that it is an Oscar worthy performance. But the fact that his character of Arthur Fleck is compromised from the start with both psychological issues and a laughing condition, which makes him laugh uncontrollably when he is nervous or anxious, dumbs down the origins story. One does subsequently feel pity for Arthur throughout the film from seeing him get mobbed by kids on the street, being refused psychological treatment due to funding cuts, being treated terribly by his work colleagues and boss, having to look after his elderly mother, the issue of unrequited love with his neighbour, his subsequent humiliation at the hands of Robert De Niro's character and learning about his mother's past, which leads to the bloody and brutal finale. Ultimately, Arthur's transformation to the Joker is due to the brutality and harshness of society and the way it treats those who are different. Whether this is through its lack of caring for the the sick, the elderly, the mentally challenged or even the physically disabled. The fact that he shows some sympathy to the dwarf character, also strongly suggests that this Joker is not actually evil. This is the complete antithesis of what the Joker is. Infact, I really don't see this interpretation of the Joker successfully standing off against Batman. As a result the film left me somewhat dissapointed. Part of this was also because the script was very poorly written.The redeeming part of the film is the ending, which combined with several earlier flashback scenes makes you wonder whether the events in the film even took place or were just a figment of Arthur's imagination, very similar to the ending of Sergio Leone's 'Once Upon a Time in America', which suggests that Robert De Niro's character may have dreamed up all the events of the movie. After all the joker does state in the comic book 'The Killing Joke' that if he prefers to have a past, he would rather it be multiple choice, so this is a valid hypothesis. Which leaves us to ponder whether this film should be considered as Cannon to the Batman universe or not. I myself prefer that it was not considered to be cannon and an glad that it is a standalone film.The film is inspired of numerous films throughout the decades, which includes the Kings of Comedy, Clockwork Orange, Taxi Driver, Falling Down, Only God Forgives and Drive. However, I personally don't think it has the intelligence or effectiveness of Falling Down or indeed the panache of another film that I recently saw from Indian cinema, which I would highly recommend to readers, called Wajood starring the brilliant Nana Patekar. For me the Joker could have been a better film as a standalone study of mental illness, without the Batman Franchise being associated with it."
7/10,A gorgeously crafted baroque film with a sheer hollow inside.,shabbir-ahmad1994,10/22/2019,"A confused representation of insanity from a perspective of a sane person, a celebration of madness and chaos.At last, I have watched one of the most anticipated movies of this year.I experienced sadness, creepiness, joy, rage, confusion altogether, and it felt good.The story was above average, sometimes the director seemed confused about what he's trying to say.There were so many beautiful distinct pieces scattered throughout the film that gives you chills but ultimately they failed to form a complete landscape, eventually it became a gorgeously crafted baroque film with a sheer hollow inside.It criticizes our self-centered, pretentious, empathy less society but ironically the movie itself falls under its own sword.Welcome, Tod Phillips to the big boy's club! His direction was crafty and pretty awesome though lack a little bit of originality. His trick with Arthur's illusion seemed a bit risky given its context. We will never know for sure if Arthur did go Murray's show or not!The cinematography was superb, there were plenty of scenes that'll enter your mind and stay there for a while.Joaquin Phoenix did his best, tried hard to embody the magnanimous character of Joker, he did pretty well, but sometimes it felt he was just trying too hard. Despite it's unfair to compare him with great heath ledger I must say he was able to pull it off impressively and takes this Joker to a distinct level. It was a one-man show and he's gonna get nominated for the academy award for sure.One of the most entertaining and satisfying aspects of this film is its music composition, damn! It was too good, and you'll get to see some insane dance move as a bonus.The main problem with this film is the lack of originality and a precise plot, sometimes it felt like the movie itself was confused and wandering aimlessly! That's why it failed to become a complete cinematic art rather than a montage of eye pleasing scenes, and nothing more.Overall, despite its shortcomings, this movie is definitely one of the most exciting movie of this year.My Rating:7.5/10"
3/10,"Dark, serious, tense... and bad!",paullevantis,10/19/2019,"Somehow the darkest and most serious movies get the highest ratings. People say that this movie is so thrilling and that Joaquin Phoenix deserves an Oscar but at the end of the day, it wasn't entertainment. There were so many evil moments and dark scenes but what's so good about that?This movie was almost like instructions on how to be a psycho. They flipped the usual idea and boundaries of good and evil for the audience to feel sorry for the bad guy. People seem to think this is a good thing. It's bad!The point of a movie is to entertain audiences and this movie just made me feel depressed and miserable. I'll have to watch a movie where the hero is clear and the villain is clear so I can actually be entertained. The fundemental and successful formula for a film."
1/10,Who's the real joker?,ivonieling,10/20/2019,"I don't understand the high ratings. I went to the cinema with high expectations, only to discover that the movie was slow as anything and was almost finished before the first killing happened. It was a dreadful time having to wait for something to happen.But yes, once the movie was finished and I finally walked out, I got the cosmic joke; I was the joker, trusting the reviews and leaving disappointed in disbelief I actually paid for watching it."
10/10,An Epic movie for a Legendary villian,bipindongol,9/1/2019,A movie worthy of an oscar. One of the best movie in superhero genre since The Dark Knight. Phoenix is the actor who was born for this role after Ledger.
9/10,Joaquin pheonix as the Joker an Absolute Masterpiece!!!!,Prash_Vengatesh,9/2/2019,"As an DC fanboy lost hope on DC when they made JL, but i eventually started going back to the cinemas after Wonderwomen and Aquaman. When The Joker film was announced as Joaquin pheonix in the lead i must say i had my doubts. I was pretty sure noone could even match Heath ledger's Joker.. I was wrong. This might be the best DC film ever made! Joaquin pheonix did the impossible. Mindblowing performance as the joker! The best after Heath Ledger! Movie of the year! The laughs, screams, craziness and the dark psychological sufferings of the Joker will haunt you for the rest of the year. I must say The Joker is back! Trust me on this!9/10 on this one!P.S This is my second 9/10 for a DC movie after TDK."
3/10,Overhyped movie,sushreetamohanty,10/9/2019,"I just didn't get the hype about this movie. And why are we entertaining such violent movies. It wasn't nearly as good as I expected it to be. No doubt the acting was good, but apart from that there's no story. It's dark depressing movie, about a guy who's dealing with bipolar disorder and killing everyone around him, including his Mother. What kind of negative message is it passing on to the society."
6/10,Dissappointing and Underwhelming,Jamarama97,10/7/2019,"Just to say that the film left me wanting to watch ""The King of Comedy"" and ""Taxi Driver"" the whole time, plus a few of the other films that this film strongly references. Joaquin Phoenix is fantastic however and the film has all the top production values that you'd expect of a big studio picture but it's generic and predicable in my opinion. It takes from so much that it's not it's own film for me. By no means is the film awful, it's just soulless. I'm not trying to be deliberately obtuse and against the tide of support for this film either, there are things as I've mentioned to commend and I'd like to add that going the way of gritty R rated film making is what I've wanted for years, from a more dramatic viewpoint, I thought ""Logan"" did what this film failed to do for me as a darker comic book oriented film. I hope people can respect my opinion just as I respect the free speech of everyone who really liked the film. Finally, I will add that those who have bashed the film for violence do not know what they're talking about. There are far more violent films than this and if one person or even a handful of people were incentivised to cause harm to others, the rest of us shouldn't have to pay for the odd few thank you very much. It's an interesting watch for certain and I'd recommend watching for that reason alone."
1/10,Derivative and Uninspired,indigomontoya,10/19/2019,"There is doing an homage and then there is borrowing wholesale from other material. This film is little more than a remake of ""Taxi Driver"" with elements (most notably the end) borrowed from ""Network"".In the case of ""Taxi Driver"" there are whole lines of dialogue, characters and scenes that are lifted from it and placed in this movie. Except the execution isn't as polished, the acting not of the same caliber and the story not as original.Watch ""Taxi Driver"" and ""Network"", this film was made 40 years earlier and was made better."
1/10,I really don't understand.,cvmann,11/11/2019,"Joaquin Phoenix is good. The directing is pretty good. The writing is absolutely awful. This movie is trying so hard to be relevant and to have a 'message' that it just throws a jumbled mess of quasi-commentary at you hoping something will stick. It is completely unclear what exactly writer/director Todd Phillips is actually trying to say, if anything. Is Joker a hero of the resistance or is he an incel? Does he go crazy because he's mentally ill or because people are mean to him? Both rich people and poor people are horrible to Joker so what exactly is the class commentary? It's also confusing how Robert De Niro when this movie is clearly ripping off Taxi Driver in many ways, also with a little Mr. Robot thrown in. There's also a subplot with a neighbor that is so incredibly stupid and pointless, which actually has no bearing on the story whatsoever. The movie is also just listless and boring throughout much of it. A movie can be slow-paced without it being boring if interesting things are happening that are driving the plot towards it's conclusion. The only thing driving the story in this movie is knowing that he's going to become joker at some points, not anything that actually happens in the movie. The movie also spends like 5 minutes making fun of a little person for no clear reason. Also for people saying that this movie does a good job saying why you should be nicer to people especially if they're lonely or have mental health issues: firstly you shouldn't need a movie like this to be nice to people, secondly you can make a movie like that where the lonely/mentally ill person doesn't become a murderer since mentally ill people are more likely to be victims than perpetrators of crime, and thirdly if you want a movie showing why you need to empathize with criminals why not movies about all the people of color who have been victims of mass incarceration and were locked up on nonviolent charges instead of a movie about a white male becoming a mass murderer. This movie is terrible."
1/10,So overrated/overhyped,rikesh-95638,10/26/2019,Don't waste 2 hours of your life this movie is the baddest i've seen in a long time. Crappy writing and no good storyline...it was boring. I went to the pay counter to ask my money back for the 2 hours of torture...they can't do people like this. And for all the people with 10/10(the reason why i went) you're a  joke.
6/10,Absolutely not a 10,rayan22-186-745119,10/6/2019,"Strong fanboy and hype rush going on.The movie is good don't get me wrong, the cinematography is amazing, the acting is brilliant, but the story is a bit predictable if you have an iq above 90. Its also really slow paced which can be annoying at times. Deff has it flaws and is in no way even comparable to Batman the dark knight. The movie is a 7 but I gave it a 6 to compensate for all the fanboy 10s"

1/10,Overrated and boring,krazysoon,10/25/2019,"One of the worst movies I have ever seen. Ok, maybe not but they hype surrounding the movie killed it for me. It's not a masterpiece but an ok film. Why the one star? Way too many 10's! For once I actually agree with the actual critics who graded this film."
1/10,Joke's on You,mkouta,10/27/2019,"This film is about mental illness. Specifically, a mental illness called creative diarrhoea. In the film, a band of Hollywood's most insipid producers, writers, directors and other such riffraff suffering from this ailment got together for a group therapy session, in which the therapist, a Hollywood mogul, had them 'let it all out', gathered the refuse and flogged it off for a few hundred million dollars.Seriously though, there is sooo much wrong with this movie. I won't even start with how I knew that a Joker sob story had no hope of (artistic) success, nor with why I went I went to see it anyway. I'll start by pointing out other reviewers' observation that this is not even the Joker. He's not suave, he's not witty, there are no lethal gimmicks, no morbid jokes, no anarchism, and he isn't a criminal mastermind. He's just a loser that goes off on a school shooter streak.Secondly, this is not, as I said earlier, a film about mental illness. It is a mockery of it, cashing in on the increasing awareness about mental health. There is not one concept about psychosis or other mental health problems judiciously explored in the movie (an illness which causes the sufferer to laugh in inappropriate situations? Seriously?!). All you're getting here is a downtrodden loner being subjected to beatings and injustices designed to spark indignation in the viewer, then going off on a murder spree.With regards to the much-praised acting, it's a mystery to me how anyone could have come to a judgement of Phoenix's theatrical achievement based off such an asinine script, because I can't. Not that you should devote an iota of attention to any of these positive reviews, because I'm fairly confident that there is some large-scale review rigging going on.The plot is one dimensional and juvenile, the dialogue as engaging as a monotone nursery rhyme and the character development shallow. There were goofs left right and centre, like revolvers with zero recoil and 8 bullets. Why did Arthur keep dancing? Why did we need to see Arthur fondling himself? Why is he so emaciated? Why so much smoking? I watched so many close-ups of cigarettes burn out it makes me wonder if the film was sponsored by the tobacco industry.The two positives in the movie for me were firstly, the final talk show scene, littered though it was with imperfections like the rest of the movie, which did have me sitting a little less slouched in my seat. Also, there were some interesting theories presented tying the Joker with the Batman.With the bar set so high by The Dark Knight, no director seeking artistic acclaim will go near the Joker for many years to come, maybe ever, but on the other hand, the Joker character has been rendered a boon for Hollywood opportunists, and this is the second time we've seen the character butchered in a low effort high budget money maker. This one will be forgotten quick, but I don't know how long it will be before the Joker himself recovers."
2/10,So disappointed by this film,huntj-59716,10/14/2019,Was really looking forward to seeing this film. However having seen it I am very disappointedThe acting was brilliant however I was bored unroll the last half an hour. I have never considered walking out a cinema until nowI would say you have to go and see it as you can see by the reviews some people love it
6/10,Great portrayal of joker but a slow film and overhyped,kylejmattison,10/4/2019,"Some great moments, doesn't really live up to the hype though.Phoenix's prediction of Joker's descent into madness was really interesting to watch and he will get many plaudits but the film felt like it was missing something. A few plot holes and areas where you feel like it's being dragged out longer than it needs to be. Definitely worth a watch, but don't go in expecting to see a 'film of the year'.Ledger still on top."
7/10,SOLID! But don't believe the hype...,ladiesman228,10/14/2019,"Joaquin Phoenix's performance is excellent, but the film is flawed, the main offenders being a second act twist that's visible a mile away and a small scene during the ending that feels tacked on.However, you should see this film at least once."
1/10,If I could give -1star....,fayeberg,10/11/2019,"Disturbing with very little entertainment value at all. I'm sitting in the theater feeling extremely uncomfortable and my mind is wandering to all of the young, white, disturbed men that have senselessly murdered people in our country. I don't feel this film would illicit the same behavior with stable individuals but we cannot know what impact it would have on emotionally disturbed people.

10/10,DC's masterpiece. Although a huge risk for the studio -- it paid of. A lot.,nprodromidis,9/4/2019,"I had the chance of seeing a screening of Joker at the Venice Film Festival last week. 'Joker' was easily one of the highlights of the festival thanks to Joaquin Phoenix's breathtaking performance and Todd Phillips' clever directing.Although the movie consists of an amazing supporting cast, you mostly watch the movie through Arthur's (Joker's) lenses. Arthur is present in every scene of the movie, ala taxi drive. The movie clearly draws inspiration from Scorsese's 80s work (most notably from Taxi Driver and King Of Comedy. There's a lot of nods and easter eggs for the fans of those two movies). The gotham city we see in this movie is the most corrupt version to date, which is to be expected when our beloved caped crusader doesn't exist. It's a nightmarish vision of New York where corruption, crime and chaos are the leading forces behind everything. The story takes clever twists and turns that will leave even the most hardcore and well-read DC fans with their jaws on the floor. I wish I could talk about them but I don't want to go into spoilers. As for Joaquin Phoenix's performance as the clown prince of crime, there's really not much to say that you haven't read already. Phoenix literally transforms into both the role of Arthur Fleck and the Joker, giving us a super realistic and groundbreaking performance that even the Oscars cant snob. Joker is a strong contender for best picture.This movie is a must watch for both comic book and drama fans alike. It's a deep character study of a mentally ill man slowly sinking into madness that shouldn't be overlooked by anyone.Overall, this movie gets a 10/10 from me. I cant wait to see more small budget comic book movies about other DC villains (or heroes!)."
1/10,Disappointing,tuggke,10/13/2019,"There was nothing mentally or emotionally intriguing about this film. Outside of the amazing lead acting, this movie's only suprise was that a known antagonist was the main character.The script was lackadaisical. The events were over dramatized and intangible.As a person who's suffered from mental illness myself, this movie did not portray a mentally ill person. It exponentially exaggerated what goes on with in the mind of the victim. Those who enjoy this portrayal are likely the non victims.As for how the comic book character was written: this story did adapt the idea that the joker knows he's a villain and enjoys it. At the end Arthur is still just a guy going to extremes to be accepted by society, instead being the joker who reshapes/exposes society to be something he thrives in."
4/10,Totally overhyped.,dayana421,10/6/2019,"Don't fall for it this movie is totally overhyped, borders between boring and irritating. Joaquin is good but the movie has no story and goes on aimlessly. Joaquin's behavior and crazy laughter is so repetitious. Who wrote those 10 star reviews??

2/10,Not worth the hype ..,ailieanderson,10/20/2019,"Leading up to the films release it had high expectations and if im honest i was quite disappointed with the film, i felt like the storyline was pretty good and the acting although the long and boring execution of it is what killed it for me"
1/10,I don't get it,berge_jason,10/24/2019,Yes Joaquin's performance is good and the cinematography is pretty but otherwise I do not get all the hype about this movie.Not for a long time have I felt like I would be better off leaving the cinema than staying and getting my money's worth.For something that was supposed to be gritty and real it had a lot of convenient scenes to help push the plot along.Very disappointed.
3/10,As much of a masterpiece as my butt!,theolevantis,10/19/2019,"These reviews claiming this movie to be a ""masterpiece"" etc etc, are absolutely ridiculous. You know the story before you walk in. Much of what happens you predict well in advance. Rather than entertain the audience, it relies on you being fascinated by the antics of a psychotic nutcase whilst trying to convince you that he is somehow heroic."

2/10,A well shot and well acted student film,clcullerton,10/14/2019,"Throw a bunch of money at a great cinematographer and a great actor, then throw in some gratuitous senseless murder in a comic book universe and watch the fanboys drool. ""It's like Scorsese!"" Yes it's derivative, except made by the dudes who brought you Road Trip and Hangover 3. Clichés galore and hardly any suspenseful scene building. It's crap, don't fall for it."
3/10,Other reviewers are biased,elvisgoya,10/11/2019,"This movie is a shallow look at mental disorders, and somehow is 2 hours but moves in no direction and drops you back to the beginning. Do not waste your money, go see Hustlers."
10/10,"A true ""kino"" experience; the most revolutionary and subversive film since Fight Club",Michael Kenmore,10/11/2019,"Normally I write the long review, but I'm going to keep it simple and concise this time.Without spoiling anything -- I suggest you do not read critics' reviews and watch this with a moderate expectation -- this film is an unexpected masterpiece, and the best comic book-based adaptation since Superman (1978).I have seen plenty of superhero movies, and I concur with Martin Scorsese's criticism of that as ""not cinema"" even though I differ with Scorsese's own output as self-indulgent and pretentious (in particular The Departed and Hugo were bloated and awful).However, Joker should be officially considered ""kino"" which is German for cinema, and utilized as a code of sorts among the Internet culture crowd to indicate ""encore; masterpiece; outstanding"".Watching this achieved something I did not expect, and that is of astonishment and catharsis. For that, my hat off to the reformed DC studio (which fired CEO after Justice League movie as a mega-flop to replace with a new leader) and Warner Bros that gave Todd Phillips and co. the chance to produce the bravest ""heavy and dark with the purpose"" cinema since, say, Fight Club, the latter I disliked but understood its messages.Joaquin Phoenix will not only own the Best Actor Oscar, but also that this film will sweep the Oscars with Todd winning Best Director and possibly Best Picture (Bradley Cooper being one of the producers)."
10/10,Amazing movie,UberWatcher,10/10/2019,This movie gave me goosebumps and kept me on my toes for its entire duration. Joaquin Phoenix made me believe that he WAS the Joker himself which is actually insane.
1/10,Overrated and overhyped,teo-rado,10/19/2019,"Story was just really unconvincing. Nobody really cares that much about some random dude who is as ineloquent and uninspired as the joker is. The hype portraying the movie as painful and cruel is just cringe. To see this rated better than ""One flew over cuckoos nest"" that shows way better cruelty saddens me."
5/10,Good acting.... Disappointing over all film,marialeonie,10/6/2019,"Brilliant acting for this film, found myself I was waiting for something to happen, get the message about mental health and how bad the system is, but something missing for me"
10/10,All It Takes Is One Bad Day!,staticstation1,10/3/2019,"Joker was epic. It's a fantastic character study centred around the most popular comic book villain of all-time but crafts a story that makes this incarnation of the character stand on its own. It's a beautifully crafted piece with stunning cinematography and art direction. I'm a fan of this changed appearance of the Joker. And Todd Phillips does a fantastic job in the director and writer's chair. Phillips' tackling of certain political and social issues will spark conversations in groups full of people smarter than myself, but I understood the messages that were coming across. But Joaquin Phoenix is one of the biggest draws of the film with such a praiseworthy performance. I don't really care for the Oscars and award shows anymore, but Phoenix deserves the accolades coming his way for such a masterful and haunting performance.One thing that I must point out, is that it's unfair to compare Phoenix to Heath Ledger's performance in The Dark Knight. They may play the character with the same name, but these are two drastically different portrayals in both performance and script and it's unjust to compare. Just worship the fact that we were given two immense performances from two different actors."
2/10,Horrible,baw66,10/15/2019,"What a horrible movie, from minute 1 you knew what's going to happen at the end. Overacting job of Phoenix. Poor acting by rest of actors."
5/10,"On the nose, silly and forced",luiginastro,10/6/2019,"Phoenix is great. The cinematography as well. That's it.The world described in the film is not realistic, despite what they try to *tell* you. They don't show, they never show. Everything that happens is finalized to sustain Fleck's downfall. It's not organic, it feels forced. A lot of ideas, none of them explored sufficiently.The movie is basically an amalgamation of Taxi Driver and King of Comedy. Too many scenes that were ""inspired"" by those two great masterpieces, that deal with these matters in an actual thoughtful and mature way.This truly is the ""we live in a society"" film.I wanted to like it, I really did. I couldn't. I'm sorry? Go cry in the corner, if you're offended by my opinion."
2/10,meh,nmd30,10/25/2019,"Basically a bad remake of taxi driver with bits of King of Comedy thrown in to replace the underage prostitute parts ... oh and lets throw a little batman stuff in there too to link it to those popular superhero movies .problem is unlike Taxi Driver the main character is very unappealing , unlikable , and hard to sympathise with ... not just getting retribution on those who have wronged him Bronson style - he's more American Psycho killing basically innocent people for fun . Glamorising violence against inocent people by the mentally disturbed not a great message to be putting out there nowadays .also wayyyy too much time wasted on Phoenix dancing and mugging to the camera - they could have cut out 45 minutes and still made the same movie just less long and boring ."
2/10,Vanilla. Just blah.,mark-butler-1991,10/13/2019,"I really don't understand all the hype over this movie. I found it to be really boring.. and by the end of this boring, very predictable movie, I felt as though I just wasted my time and money.The only reason I'm giving it two stars is because the acting was good."
10/10,Why do so many critics hate this movie?,vigcyn-665-195614,10/11/2019,"It's beyond me why so many critics have panned and even encouraged people to skip this picture. I'm not exactly sure of why the vendetta's so personal; it's obviously struck a nerve . I'm taking critics less and less seriously since they rave about tripe like 'Lady Bird"" while trying to bludgeon a masterpiece like 'Joker'. This is the first ten I recall ever giving to a movie."
2/10,No. Just No.,joshuacgordon,10/9/2019,"If you want to watch a superhero/villain movie, then go somewhere else. If you want to see a ""descent into madness"" movie, watch Taxi Driver instead. This is just that movie with more graphic violence and - oh yeah - instead of driving a taxi at the end, this guy puts on clown makeup.The movie was also way to political, and it's message is just the same rehashed junk you get from most Hollywood movies nowadays. Just with more graphic violence and - oh yeah - clown makeup.Phoenix does a fantastic job, which is why I gave this 2 stars rather than 1. But the movie is twice as long as it needs to be and is only half as good as it should have been. I'd rather take the 2 hours I sat through this to re-watch The Dark Knight, where we see the Joker that his movie should have been."
10/10,Utterly Brilliant acting,karthik-44463,10/7/2019,Joaquin nailed the joker character. Who would act so well without becoming one? The transformation is remarkable and leaves an image in me. Could not get the beat off from me.

10/10,Just give Mr. Phoenix all the awards for 2019.,avinashsiebel,10/2/2019,I don't need to elaborate more - A masterpiece performance to the highest order. This is psychologically revolutionary portrayal of a deranged character.
1/10,Chaos is not a solution,post-460-883841,10/27/2019,"First of all, sorry for my bad English.Btw, I went to cinema on hype wave with mr. Phoenix's Joker (and, of course, Im big lover of Jokers portated by mr. Ledger and mr. Nicholson). But what I saw in this movie is unacceptable.In any cases Joker is handsome character but the cause of his actions is always in his mind (or in his insanity). But not here. Mr. Phoenix's Joker - is a victim on society and mr. Philips say to us that ALL bad actions that we saw in the past - is the result of society. But its can't be true!If its true, then society WANTS to have shootings in Orland, Carolina, Las Vegas, all this peoples (and childrens!) were kill by our hands. Thats what i saw in this movie. All the human's pain was produced by our hands, by my hands, but this is not true, mr. Philips. I dont want to had 9/11, i dont want to have WWII (and WW1 also). This is not my birthday wish. So you was wrong, mr. Philips, with idead of this movie.If i want to protest against the society - I will take some anti-drugs flyiers and give it to my friends or visit some schools to tell childrens that they have to care of their siblings and help their parents or tall with parents to teach children do rights things in their future. Thats will be my protest against society. But not making a chaos.Btw, good play, mr. Phoenix, very well done. Hope you will take Oskar for that."
7/10,"Juaquin is impressive, Joker is not",markmalkom,10/13/2019,"How is this Joker suppost to stand a chance against Batman? I thought what made joker such a great villain was his intelligence, his manipulative ability and his ability to see the inner fears of his rivals. How far will he get by only being crazy and unpredictable? Juaquin could problably get pretty far (all the way to the Oscars stage), while Joker can't even enter through a door."
10/10,Best movie this year so far,runtran-90852,10/4/2019,"I was so hype after the trailer, and kinda expecting to be disappointed because DC you khow... but well it turn out even better than what the trailer had shown, and im grad its.The acting in this movie is too good, hat off to the new joker Joaquin Phoenix. He deserved an oscar for this act.The story line is still kinda classic joker's but its darker and a lot more twist, i cant count how many time i almost jump off my sit by suprise and excitement.And there is sooo many dark joke... i love it."
2/10,Unpopular opinion: Terrible movie,labeed-11526,10/16/2019,"Just watched the movie, and I had to make an account just to put it out there, after hearing tons and tons of praises, that this movie has failed terribly in living up to the hype! I know that my opinion is extremely unpopular, but someone needs to say it. Joaquin Phoenix is brilliant as the joker, in regards to his acting, but that is probably the only positive thing about this movie. And I believe that a movie needs much more than just good acting. This movie does not even have a proper climate, and is basically about a mental illness, where I feel there is no hint of the charismatic, sick and brilliant joker we got to see in the batman series!"
1/10,Very Disappointing,briand-16331,10/17/2019,"Film was directed and produced poorly. Opportunity to take advantage of the incredible Joaquin Phoenix was blown.Gratuitous violence. Misplaced violence. Wrong approach to joker.Disappointing connection to viewer. Film was wandering for long periods. Tons of footage that should have hit the cutting room floor.I really wanted an stirringly creepy connection with Joaquin as Joker. It wasn't there.If you are looking for Joaquin moment like in Gladiator, you will be very disappointed."
1/10,Lame,jthomas-05413,10/13/2019,"This movie was so boring, I kept falling asleep. I felt very awkward several times. My son & I kept looking at each other like should we just get up & leave? I probably should have. I cant believe some of the reviews on here. People have very crappy taste apparently. Just shows you, don't believe the reviews. If a movie speaks tour interest, go see it for yourself. This movie however, I wouldn't recommend. It's a total bore."
1/10,Slow,psychboy15,10/12/2019,This movie was so slow... it felt like I had lost about 10 years of my life. The performances were good but it took so long to get to the interested parts. This movie was also super depressing. I could not get into it and didn't feel any empathy for the Joker. I was hoping that this would be better than wonder woman but it was worse
1/10,"2 hours full of bad , bad mood.",pedrovelazquezdiaz,11/5/2019,"Joaquín Phoenix's unconvincing laughing, and looking like a beaten dog had brutaly ennoyed me after 5 minutes.The world is mean and bad, and you can only be bad and hit back. Chaos, anarchy, whatever .. inspires bye a clown who killed 3 bullies.More of this stupid excess of brutality in the name of... what?Yes. It is the same director as in the hangover 3.I don't want to be a partir of this.Brutal and boring."
10/10,I created an account just to rate and comment on this movie. I am not a batman movies fan.,filip-15019,10/24/2019,"I'm not usually a fan of comic based movies. I was never a fan of batman because I'm having a hard time taking people in costumes seriously. I went to watch joker because all of the hype and I was genuinely expecting it to be a so-so performance. I went there watching the Heath Ledger's joker before, which was OK in my opinion, as I said, I'm not a batman movies fan.However.This movie is not about batman, is not about comics, is not about superheros. This is a drama film. A drama which touches you deep inside on a special level, a movie which you feel because at least once you will sympathize with the joker. You will find yourself debating inside, whether he should be excused for his actions. Seeing Phoenix portray Arthur, from a beaten man, to become THE joker, quite by accident, is an extraordinary journey. The movie deserves all the praise it gets, and some.I can't recommend the movie enough, as it's just THAT good."
2/10,It thinks its really artistic,micdekk,10/17/2019,"Joaquin Phoenix does a great job with the part he was dealt - but the movie itself was very bad. Draggy, with truly shallow character development (he is mentally troubled and Gotham is a harsh environment, you dont need 2 hours to convey that properly...).Todd Phillips is clearly at a loss to convey deep ideas through film. The trip through Joker is cluttered with terrible plot devices that offer to lead the plot down an interesting path, but inevitably lead to the most predictable, uninteresting conclusion you could have predicted.Saving comparisons for last - this movie just doesnt do justice for the Joker. He is meant to be a villian, not someone who to relate to. The Heath Ledger Joker was dark, twisted, and yet there was still relatability in his madness, one could understand his motives despite their general lack of morals, however this Joker seems to just be grasping for your pity - to the very conclusion of the film where you wont be sure if the triumphant music is supposed to be ironic, or if you are really supposed to feel like Arthur Flecks story has arrived at its fated end - Im quite sure the movies creators dont know themselves."
3/10,best movie ive seen in years!!! seriously im a amateur critic n loved this movie along with outstanding performance,techsavy,10/12/2019,Ive only seen a few batman movies so i decided to go watch joker and since joaquin was the leading actor i thought it would be decent. i was impressed with the movie completely from the narrative to the soundtrack to the ending. and acting from joaquin was phenomenal deserves a OSCAR hands down!!! best performance ive seen in years since decaprio and the revenant. its so good im going next weeknd and watch it again...i havent done that since well ive never done that before. 10/10 movie i couldnt find a flaw in his acting role
10/10,#!%! Bruce Wayne!!!,castoirebenjamin,10/9/2019,Thank goodness I didn't bring my little one with me. Me and my older kids enjoyed it. This movie is very dark and violent. One of the best prequels I have ever seen. Mr. Phoenix really deserves an Oscar for his portrayal of the Joker. This one of my top two movies this year. Almost two and a half hours long but worth it!

10/10,Phenomenal,jbrozena,10/4/2019,"Absolutely one of the best movies I have seen, and will see again...I enjoyed every twist, turn, and the furthering of the evolution of the character and the slow and drastic turn to violence and chaos at a whim. Fantastic movie!"
10/10,One of the hardest things is living to the hype. It's even better.,educallejero,10/4/2019,"Little to say. I expected a masterpiece of a movie only based on comic books, and concentrated only in a character study for the ages.It is.Perfect story. Twists. Real drama. Real pain. Darkly funny at times, but not comedic in the least. It is violent, as it should, but never glorifying violence like the rest of the comic book adaptations (even the ones I love like Man of Steel or Infinity War or...)It is just perfect. I give my ""Thanks"" to all the people involved (I gave my money too, which is more important to them).----------- As a negative, It's not particularly original, with too many things (a few times, scenes) from King of Comedy and Taxi Driver.It is clearly better than those movies though"
10/10,"If Phoenix doesn't win an Oscar for this, We confirm that the whole industry is fake!",L_Copa,10/2/2019,"This is the definition of the word STUNNING! Because that's what Phoenix was at this movie! It is a performance of a lifetime! I have no idea how he achieved this turn and brought this character to its highest but it cant get any better. We love all Jokers but here we have a different character, a different man, a man that we can finally understand, finally understand Joker's Why... This character was portrait-ed multidimensional by Phoenix! It was about time to expose today's society. This movie will shock you in a way, make you sad and at the end it will make you happy with the Batman connection and the comic and gaming scene! The whole movie was a masterpiece and can lead to many awesome sequels with Batman, Harley Quin etc... They just need to be careful. An Oscar performance with a small budget! Good job DC."
10/10,Joaquin deserves the Oscar,punyapas_gam,10/4/2019,The best movie of this year. The best Joker I have ever seen. Very realistic
10/10,Dark but Entrancing,dmcclusky-74709,10/4/2019,"I'll first start by saying this movie is very dark. It's the type of movie that makes you uncomfortable at some point in every scene. That being said, it's exactly the way this character should be portrayed. Amazing performance by Joaquin Phoenix as he takes you through the journey for Jokers evolution. This isn't a movie full of action packed fighting or battle scenes. Instead, it's a real life example that mirrors our world today. Amazing performances. Amazing film."
10/10,It's just so dark and so awesome,jakshat-85580,10/2/2019,I was just stunned after watching the movie . A sure nomination for the Oscars !!!
3/10,Unreasonable & gloomy movie,nguyennamsinger,10/14/2019,"Cannot understand why this movie gets high score. The content is so bad, gloomy and unreasonable. It is exaggerated too much. How can a mad guy who kill 03 men become a symbol for a mad society??? How can rich men always badly treat or make difficulty to poor guy??? Any reason for a mad crowd tries to protest a senator who is just only standing as a candidate for President position???Three stars for the good performance of main character."
4/10,Quite Boring really,bigjayce,10/10/2019,"I went to see this last night and I have to say I was really looking forward to it, when I came out of the cinema all I could think is why the hell did I want to go see that so much!!Joaquin Phoenix is fantastic as Joker but thats pretty much the only positive I can say about this.The film is 2 hours long and I can honestly say I was totally bored for the first 90 minutes, the last half hour is better but not by much. I found myself looking at my watch thinking when is it going to start, where is the gruesome violence that apparently makes people leave the cinema, in short it's not really there, I think they were leaving because they were bored."
1/10,Dark Gloomy Disturbing Horrible should be R rated,judwllccks,11/2/2019,Hated was looking forward to it. Its not for anyone to watch. Promotes hate violence suicide and Murder.Please pick another movie to go to. Not sure what movie the other people were watching.
2/10,Mental illnesses...,alics-70920,10/13/2019,Do not lead to torturing children (mother) nor murdering people.
10/10,Anti-hero main characters have never been this good (to be bad),lostcoinjanzent,10/9/2019,"This is an origin story of a famous superhero villain, and not quite. You don't need to have extensive knowledge on all the lore of DC supers because Joker is a fresh new take on the very popular character. It is a film with an anti-hero protagonist, and an anti-superhero in terms of its overall tone. I must say, it is storytelling at its finest."
10/10,Character Study in the tone of Taxi Driver,tybaltbs,10/6/2019,This was a wonderful study of the what could be behind the Joker. It is also a great commentary on our society and times and how the Media and the 1% create all of the problems that the rest of us are expected to deal with. Thomas Wayne is a great representation of the elite political class and how they think they know what is best for everyone.
10/10,"Certainly not Jack's ""Joker"" or even Heath's still an excellent and dark artistic performance from Joaquin that had my face smiling and that's life!",blanbrn,10/4/2019,"Many of us over the years have been attached and thrilled with the ""Clown Prince of Crime"" as D.C. comic fans know as the one and only ""Joker"". And we've seen different takes and spins from Romero's camp, to Ledger's dark wild crazy turn, and the man the one and only Jack played the clown with vanity and brought a proper turn to a bad guy while having fun(Nicholson's ""Joker"" was like that of the late 70's early 80's ""Joker"" in D.C. comics) now enter Phoenix who's much different with a creepy origin story.Set in the early 1980's Gotham city is gritty, raw and the social and political climate is in the gutter as just getting by is so tough. And just tip toeing and dancing his way thru the drama is Arthur Fleck(in a hell of a turn from Joaquin at least nominate him for a ""Golden Globe"" or ""Oscar"") a lonely and depressed mommies boy who's a skinny starving clown who just can't fit in he's a society misfit. It's really somewhat of a sad character study.However hope is possible in the form of Fleck wanting to get away from being a clown for children as his real dream is to be a standup comedian as his smile and crazy lasting laugh is always present! As laughter is the cure for his pain! His hope of escape is to appear on a late night talk show hosted by Murray Franklin(Robert De Niro) where Arthur hopes to showcase his talents. Also the only other wild card pleasure he has in his life is dating a single mom named Sophie(Zazie Beetz) from his apartment building. And his sick mother Penny keeps Arthur hanging on with love and hope as that keeps him hanging on.Only secrets and ghost of the past and painful memories only destroy the fragile mind of Arthur even more as a connection to millionaire Thomas Wayne is revealed and even more shattering is how this connection and more events will lead to ""The Dark Knight"". Great and excellent work from director Todd Phillips who despite making a stand alone dark character study still connects things up with others in the D.C. universe.Many might see this picture as a dark tragedy I think it's a take and spin on how one is affected by life and then they take on a different role after years of being abused and mistreated in the world by it's people. Still this film is excellent because it's unique and finally glad a stand alone movie celebrates ""The Joker""(the greatest comic book bad guy ever!) As Joaquin's performance was raw, gritty, and a lashing out of some payback to society. Wow enough said best D.C. comics character study ever made!"
10/10,Amazing Movie,mikuthakur,10/4/2019,"Very good movie. The first half of the movie was slow, but second half was amazing"
10/10,That's life,tylertrudeau-73547,10/4/2019,"Such an incredible reimagining of a fan favorite classic supervillain. This movie is set in the 80s but consistently feels like present times, which is a triumph in itself. Joaquin Phoenix again cements his immense range and talent as he completely absorbs the audience with his commitment to the character. Director Todd Phillips also proves once and for all that he too has a wide range of talent as a director and can take his films to the next level.Astonishingly beautiful score writtenCompletly grasping and thrilling plotThought provoking message about mental health and the underprivileged in this country.10/10 Would Highly Reccomend"
10/10,Phoenix is the same level as Ledger,thomaslepro,10/3/2019,"Phoenix fitted so we'll in his role as The Joker, reminded me of Health Ledger."
2/10,"Superb acting. Complete misrepresentation of people suffering from mental health difficulties, only adding to the stigma.",stephanojvr,11/11/2019,"I have looked forward to this movie for a long time. A big fan of the character and the actors themselves.I was very disappointed. The acting from this movie was brilliant without fault. I would give it 10/10 if it were based on that alone.The Joker character is supposed to be an extremely high trait psychopath absent of all rationale and sanity. The Joker character portrayed in this movie is human. It is someone who shows symptoms of paranoid schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. There are very few characteristics of someone that is a high trait psychopath. I have worked on psychiatric inpatient wards (including forensic) and have several degrees within the field. The Joker in this movie is a human-being that is unwell. I have done extensive research in both the fields of psychopathy and bipolar disorder. He shows symptoms of someone experiencing psychosis and very few symptoms of the dark triad (Psychopathy, Narcissism and Machiavellianism).The Joker character in the comic books and cartoons is supposed to be the most deranged killer and high trait psychopath that is INHUMANLY possible. What I saw was one of my patients suffering without help due to cuts for NHS funding, the US medical system. Adding to the stigma behind mental illness.I applaud the actors in this movie. They have represented people who experience bipolar disorder, types of schizophrenia and some personality disorder traits excellently. But this has added to the stigma of mental health difficulties. People who suffer from these conditions should not be feared.The point is..... If you ever are going to make a Joker movie again, ask for more advice from professionals.... You have added to the stigma of people who are mentally ill. Psychopathy is a trait not a disorder.Disappointed is all I can say."
2/10,Tedious and self indulgent,david-36526,10/16/2019,"Excited by the many glowing reviews I sat down in my local Odeon with anticipation to watch Joker. Unfortunately it fairly quickly became clear that the Joke was on me. I feel like the little boy in the tale of the Emperor's New Clothes, the only one able to tell the truth about what I saw. Nothing but a gloomy, depressing character study with Phoenix trying and failing to hang on to the ciat tails of the incomparable Heath Ledger. Do yourself a favour and give this one a miss. If you don't it will be two hours of your life wasted that you'll never get back."
1/10,Better if didn't saw,guilhermerpedrollo,10/19/2019,"Disturbing. Just got out of the movie. My humor was much better before seeing it. At first feel pity for the guy suffering, but he lacks charm and then well he is just a killer. Heath Ledger was far better."
10/10,a considered 10,Jmacleish,11/26/2019,"Watched this film after hearing how great it was, but also aware it was a controversial film.Simply put - this is a marvellous film, you don't need to read any of the reviewsi have watched it twice already and I'll most likely watch it again.To my mind - it's a Masterpiece.I have the feeling this film will be talked about for a long time."
3/10,A JOKER ?,lmbste,11/14/2019,"If you like movies with no story and 2 hours of blah blah nonsense, this is for you! It was by far the most boring movie of 2019. A Joaquin Phoenix who overjusts, he wants to look like Depp? Of course, I understand the story of isolation and the psychological side. But what makes this film so special that it deserves a score of 8.8? Because of Joker's laughs? Because he shot people? The dark side was much better worked in Dark Knight Rises, here we are in a dark register, gore, depressing. Strange that this film is marketed in the United States when we see that it prone the ideology of Marxism.Only the Joker had a character development. All other characters are boring stereotypes that do not contain a single story.The cliffhangers are all predictable!To conclude, I do not see this Joker fighting Batman at all."
10/10,Thank you,gamersinfuzed,10/3/2019,"Just saw the movie in a midnight premiere in our local and favorite movie theater, and all I can say is thank you! Thank you Mr. Phoenix for a truly awesome, lovable and emotional performance, thank you Mr. Phillips for your creativity and writing. When it comes to Batman and all of Gothams citizens in the movies I'm always pretty sceptic wether they'll be played and portrait right, but when Mr. Phoenix was announced as the next Joker I knew there was no need to worry, then came the first teasers and trailers and my hope grew bigger, and now all I can say is thank you!!"
2/10,"Beware of anyone who hails this as ""a masterpiece"".",robobeatnik,11/12/2019,"Simply put, this movie is no masterpiece and if you think it is, you need to see WAY more movies. And by way more movies, I mean movies that aren't superhero movies. The funny thing about all the people who call this movie ""a masterpiece"" is that they can't qualify that claim in any way. Try it for yourself - ask the next person you talk to about Joker why it's a masterpiece. If you're lucky, you might get a response that goes as deep as them saying something vague about the writing and directing being amazing. Ask them to explain that. I guarantee you they won't be able to. This movie is one note, from beginning to end. Joker is crazy at the start, and crazy at the end. There is zero nuance, subtlety or character development. He simply goes from being crazy to crazier. It is cynical, lazy and a dull retread of the REAL masterpieces (like Taxi Driver and King of Comedy) from which it shamelessly steals (poorly, I might add). Beware of anyone who calls this a masterpiece, they have zero understanding of cinema."
10/10,Insanely dark yet good,infhammer,10/6/2019,Never have I ever sat 15 mins after the movie ended just thinking about what happened. This movie is a masterpiece of this decade. I don't think any other movie of this decade will top this.
1/10,Worst movie ever,diamigonzalez,11/3/2019,Just went and watched the joker movie and it has to be the worst movie I have ever seen 1 out of 5 stars
2/10,BORING,anilergin-63856,10/13/2019,One of the worst movies I have seen in years. Best part is Cream's White Room. Director is terrible.
2/10,Overrated,thebradenz,10/12/2019,"I don't get it. I think it's a case of ""everyone thinks this is great so I should too"". I was definitely not impressed."
2/10,As movie well overrated - acting excellent,dhllon,10/9/2019,The depth of the story was lacking to much focus on such a short aspect of the jokers life and he became the joker there was not much of a journey. The constant musical score was over dramatic and did not add much to the film if anything it detracted from the movie. All the actors performed excellently but this is not a movie to be entertained by our top be taken in by all the characters as the focus is so much on one person without a real journey.This is my opinion as my partner really thought it was a good movie. In the end I could not wait for it to be finished I think the character of joker has been devoured from the comics and previous movies.
3/10,Boring,pepolas,10/7/2019,I realy dont know those Masterpiece reviews its a realy boring movie whit nothing special a about it. Heath ledger its not realy happy in the grave about this movie
10/10,Finally a movie THATS REAL! LOVE THIS MOVIE SO MUCH I HAD TO REVIEW. WHICH I HAVE NEVER DONE!!!! EPIC,lizkm,10/6/2019,AMAZING 😍 GENIUS!! A REAL MOVIE. WILL WATCH OVER AND OVER AGAIN
1/10,No.. Just... no.,raph-85738,10/25/2019,"I'm making sure to give this movie 1 star because it's definitely not a 8.9 - that's a lie.Joker is not an amazing movie. It's far from great. More to the boring side.It lacks plot twist and focus too much on character development. How many times someone needs to get punched in the face before they go crazy?He suffers, gets fired, has a mental illness, nobody loves him, he's sad and he cries and he laughs and he laughs again. And he kills some people, and that's it, that's the movie."
1/10,A disturbing take on the Joker.,offthewall101,10/23/2019,"The Joker for me was a disturbing and sometimes hard to watch revision of the Joker that not many of us saw coming, Phoenix brought a great effort to the table, but it was somewhat miss-placed for hysteria and mental illness. The Joker has always been known to be cunning, intelligent and calculating so I was surprised they made the Joker out to be so spontaneous and mentally unfit considering what we know he is capable of in a myriad of comics and movies. I do not see this version of the Joker outwitting Batman and the city of Gotham's authorities, he seems to be far too convoluted in the sense that people get to him mentally and emotionally far too easily, he is unstable and not intellectual. Heath Ledger's Joker was and always will be the pinnacle of the Joker, the perfect balance of humor, wit and insanity, it should go without saying. This Joker was just too weird and disturbed to be anything but a sideshow freak."
10/10,"Dangerously uncomfortable,",kschakradeo,10/9/2019,"Dangerously uncomfortable,"
10/10,Great origin story,bradhewison,10/4/2019,"Wasnt sure if I'd be a fan of seeing the jokers origin story on the big screen specially as half the appeal to the joker is the mystery of his origin baring the red hood origin anyway. Thought it was a brilliant watch seeing his slow decent and learning how his tragic upbringing molded him. The ending when emerged as the finished product ""the joker"" honestly dont think an origin story could of been none better and the acting performance from Joaquin phoenix was top notch!"
10/10,joker was best movie ever,zrng-84025,10/9/2019,"Cinematography and acting was perfect , and they story depend on personal perception , it will get deep in your soul if you put your self in arthur situation ."
6/10,"Disjointed, Cliched, Yet Effective",matthew-turner37,10/21/2019,"Don't listen to the unbelievably high average score, this is not a great movie. It leans on cliches, it struggles to communicate vital character details, but it manages to pull together a strong closing act to elevate an otherwise inconsistent film.'Joker' stumbles out of the gate by throwing a plethora of ""troubled loner"" cliches at us. The scenes read almost as a list, giving the early stages of the film a disjointed feel that hampers any sense of immersion. The only aspect of our lead, Arthur Fleck, that seems original is his affliction. His sudden outbursts of laughter during tense situations are used to great effect several times throughout the first act.As the story continues, 'Joker' wastes time on a sub-par subplot involving Arthur's neighbor. Another sub-plot, involving Thomas Wayne, is far more interesting and clever in its execution.Ultimately, 'Joker' becomes a story of Arthur breaking free and flourishing in the chaos of Gotham. The final act revels in his now unrestrained insanity. However, the film struggles to convey a clear image of what exactly is happening within Arthur. Is he an idiot savant, or a brilliant mastermind set free of his bonds. You can go back through the film if you wish and identify plot points to either effect if you wish (the latter seems more likely in retrospect). However, this failure of communication lessens the impact of the film, leaving you somewhat disappointed.Nevertheless, the final act is an exciting close to the film, though it probably should have ended about 5 minutes earlier than it did (the final scene is unneeded). Regardless, the result is a unique and fascinating comic book movie held back from greatness by a shaky start and questionable communication."
10/10,The upcoming Oscar winner,samehtantawi,10/4/2019,This movie will earn Oscar best Actor.My concern is this movie makes you feel sorrow for the criminals.:)
10/10,All I have are positive reviews!!!,ahmedmustafa-08528,9/2/2019,"Amazing, Fabulous, Smashing, Masterpiece, every second of this deserve a big clapTod Phillips made it like every joker fan wanted, if Joaquin doesn't get Oscar then we must check the last oscar winings!"
10/10,Flawless,alexlewis103,10/9/2019,I couldn't find a negative thing about this movie.It's bold and brilliant. Joaquin Phoenix gives one of the best performances I have ever seen.You have to go and see this. The only reason it has negative reviews is because some people were expecting another superhero movie with action - thank god it's not.
10/10,Unmatched performance!,nnairnitesh,10/5/2019,Absolutely stellar performance by Joaquin Phoenix. His portrayal of Joker is so realistic and gripping. Emotions overload.
10/10,Nothing short of a performance of a lifetime,jodo151-654-152490,10/4/2019,"Wow just wow, I was skeptical going in thinking anyone would come close to ledger or hamills jokers, but this THIS is nothing short of a performance of a lifetime by phoenix, he has BLOWN ME AWAY!"
10/10,"A classy character study on rise of the Clown Prince, Joaquin Phoenix & Todd Philips both deserve to be applauded",GlobalRanger,10/4/2019,"Aw it yesterday in India (it released here on 2nd October).. My opinion: Brilliant film helmed by Todd Philips with an Oscar worthy turn by Joaquin Phoenix as the Joker. This movie is more ""class"" than ""mass"". This is a very unique take on the character, very different from the Dark Knight's Joker that was played so awesomely by The late Heath Ledger. The film stays with you long after the end credits roll. I would like to add that it would be unfair & unnecessary to compare Joaquin's Joker with Ledger's Joker, since the same character is written differently in both films, and both these brilliant actors succeed in leaving their own unique impression on the viewer. And yes, the violence in this film has been totally overhyped some of the media outlets, the film is more a character study/drama with only a few scenes of violence that have been placed in sync with the story. Those expecting an ""action"" film, are likely to be disappointed.Though this movie was planned as a standalone, I hope the success of this film inspires a Sequel.My rating: 10/10"
10/10,Don't listen to critics. Great Movie!!,swishitsenthil,10/6/2019,"Out of this whole year I have never watched a movie that played with my emotions quite like this film. Joker is a character study on one of the most famous villains in the dc comics but this film is not what you expect. It's more of a story of a man who has a mental illness and just keeps going to the more extreme side of insanity. This movie does that so well and Joaquin Phoenix has one of the best performances of this year and deserves on Oscar. Robert De Niro, though having a small role, has an amazing performance as well. The story is very much inspired from taxi driver but is very different as well. This is a much watch movie for any person comic fan or not. MUST WATCH AMAZING MOVIE!!!!"
10/10,An exceptional study of human unhappiness and turn out!,nmreza,9/4/2019,"A thought-provoking, disturbing 2 hours long journy will haunt you for a long time. Thanks to tod phillips with an diffrent style of telling a story with an impeccable performance by Joaquin Phoenix, it is an unbelievable cinema experinece with creating a new genra of cinema as art!"
10/10,Its not a film its Art,Kanivalos1981,10/7/2019,It would take me hours to describe my feelings for this movie.I went to the cinema expecting to see a great performance from Phoenix...but...it wasnt just him....Everything was great the story the music the photography directing...Phoenix will win the oscar (im sorry for the rest of the contestants)..Everything is just WOW about him ...what a great movie ...Just a reminder to Hollywood that a great script with a great acting has no need of special effects or cgi or action scenes or whatever to make the top...Go back to movies like that ..make sure the story is good and the acting is good and forget about the restCongraz to everyone for that masterpiece...and we the viewers thank you!
9/10,Don't listen to critics,Peter_DeSilvey,10/6/2019,"It's pretty apparent the modern generation of critics are here to pader to big dumb billion dollar movies. This is an excellent take on the joker and keeps its focus on a mentally ill mans fall into absolute madness. Its dark and requires attention to follow the plot. Unlike your majority modern movies which tend focus on CGI and explosions with brief plot overviews. It also doesn't try to tick boxes to appease the 1%. It focuses on mental illness and the joker. No LGBTQ, Racism, Gun Control, Police Brutality, Women's issues etc..."
10/10,Great !,tunan,9/6/2019,DC finally gives us a good movie after keeping us waiting for a long time.
2/10,Great acting but....,rhianna_rawlins,10/20/2019,"There is a LOT of hype around this film, and a lot of people seem to think it's great, and whilst I agree Joaquin's performance is brilliant, I was bored stiff for most of this. The kind of film I'd turn off if it was on tv. I may have been harsh on the stars but I go to the cinema to be entertained and I was far from it. If I want art I'll go to a gallery."
3/10,fell asleep,imdb-62194,10/19/2019,It's just that boring. really can't understand what the hype is all about??!
2/10,lose of both time and money,wschaller2012,10/9/2019,"This was one of the worse movies I have seen. It was over acted by all actors, the story dragged on and on. I saw this movie for a bargain matinee and thought I was ripped off! The only good part was the comfy chairs and the half priced snacks!Phoenix was so over the top and not in a good way. PHOENIX STOP DANCING!!! Deniro played another version of all the parts he has played in the past few years!2 stars for the chair and 1 star for the snacks, -1 stars for wasting my day!"
10/10,Amazing!!,Batgirlw1nk,10/5/2019,"This movie is absolutely amazing!! Those giving it a bad review obviously have no clue what an origin movie is about. It is slow at first but obviously it's gotta work it's way up by telling us the story of how he became. Joaquin Phoenix doesn't disappoint in this movie, he nailed the role. I loved every bit of it."
1/10,Master joke,peeedeee-94281,10/19/2019,"That's what this movie is. Forget about all those shills with 'masterpiece' in their reviews, this movie is baaaaad. It has nothing to do with DC or the superhero/supervillain genre. A poor man's Taxi Driver in clown make-up. And 2 hours of closeups of Joaquin Phoenix's face. The joke is on the people who continue to plop down money to see this joke."
2/10,Not the Joker at all,adragon82,11/4/2019,"This movie represents everything wrong with Hollywood. Take an existing thing, make vast changes to it to the point it is no longer the thing it was, yet still call it the same thing to profit off its popularity.This story is of a loser at the end of his ropes. His life was sad, pathetic and he is powerless and thus...of course, lashes out at the world for it. This is a millennial's story. A person that blames everyone else, is a victim. There is no strength in this character. He isnt scary. He isnt a thing to be feared. This so called Joker, because he is without strength, knowledge could never be what the Joker actually is. Hard to kill, vastly intelligent and a criminal master-mind.Besides undermining every single thing that is the Joker's history, it makes a mockery of the Batman universe. This ""man"", who has no criminal history, cant fight worth a damn and is a low-IQ nit-wit, can just magically become not only Batmans greatest enemy, but can hold his own against the most powerful mob bosses and villains in the DC Universe. Why? Because he hates the world because his life sucked.Most at this point will have gone on about the deep psychological aspect of the film and claim that only a few can understand it...it is true. It is a deep psychological look at the mind of a professional victim that has failed at life and wants to burn the world because of it all while ignoring how it could never happen because a person like this could only hope to go out with a bang, literally as weak beta males can only hope to do, or ever do. It takes personal and mental strength to because a thing that gains power, keeps it, and uses it. That, makes this movie a failure on all levels other than acting. Which is supurb. Phoenix himself would make a great Joker, if he was cast to play the actual Joker.Sadly, this movie has missed the mark on coming remotely close to being like the character that is the Joker. Any incarnation of it. At least Leto was close to the New 52 Joker, enough that makes that role, more Joker than this one."
8/10,A Cynical Movie For Cynical Times,berndgeiling,10/15/2019,"Who is the crazier one?The one who is able to adapt without contradiction to the conditions of a cynical, violent and morally corrupt time, or the one reacting on those conditions with uncompromising insanity, fighting back, using his own weapons of revenge, reflecting world's madness with an insane grimace?This is the disturbing question the film poses in the figure of The Joker, equally fascinating, frightening and pitifully embodied by Phoenix, an unforgettable performance with great depth and a wide range of emotions: a Travis Bickle for the 21st century, and Robert De Niro himself paying tribute to this 43 years later after his own legendary performance in Taxi Driver."
8/10,Phoenix' chameleon charm and shades of Scorsese darken the origin story of the iconic comics villain,george.schmidt,10/5/2019,Phoenix' chameleon charm and shades of Scorsese darken the origin story of the iconic comics villain
10/10,Best movie in past couple of years,malekzadeh_kiarash,10/6/2019,"It was one of the best movies I have ever seen. The dark, tragic and well planned development of an innocent lonely man towards a brave symbol of awareness, resistance and revolution. Editing, soundtracks and direction was brilliant and breathtaking."
10/10,Phenomenal!!!!!,mjritch,9/4/2019,Phenomenal!!!!!
3/10,Awful movie,ronterry55,11/2/2019,"There is no reason for this movie to have been made. I went because of all the ecstatic reviews. Two hours of relentless blood spilling and gory murders. Giving the Joker this horrific backstory does nothing to enhance the Batman nemesis story. Joaquin Phoenix gives a silly, over-the-top performance. Robert De Nero is the only reason I gave this trash 3 stars. He enhances, but cannot save, this terrible movie."
2/10,Inhuman and terrorising,alexkatz-92989,10/10/2019,"Morally, I dislike the depiction of mental disturbances relating to violence.Filmographically, this movie tries to ""terrorise"" the spectator. Strip it from the terrorising narative and violence, the only thing left is a use of mental disturbances."
10/10,Joker Deserves Oscar... Wow,meetmustafa08,9/2/2019,I have nothing to say negative about this film. This movie shows the perfection in all aspects. leading actor done fabulous job. He will never disappoint U. Role of joker perfectly acted..
10/10,"Uncomfortable,Disturbing,Genius!",notsomighty,10/9/2019,"I haven't sat through the entire credits in stunned silence since ''let the right one in"" baring no resemblance to this movie whatsoever I was left completely speechless as to what I'd just witnessed. The term masterpiece is thrown around alot these days but Jaquin's nailed on performance of one of society's forgotton tormented souls that inevitabley arcs into the fragile but brutal criminal psychopath we know as the joker is understatedley 'perfect' to a level where the viewer is left to almost encourage Aurthur's inevitable wrong doings and sucker you into morally second guessing yourself with 'is he actually doing wrong?'I could go on but there are many other reviews for you to read that will say everything I would have said about the cinematography, music, sound,direction,set pieces, un-nerving tension, the violence, the twists and every other reason we love movies which Joker pulls off so so well.If you've not already booked to see it just drop what your doing and book.Just dont expect a superhero movie."

10/10,WoW!!!!,bbwilliams-16498,9/1/2019,This movie is getting a lot of praise and this film deserves IMO its better than Endgame and The Dark Knight!!!
1/10,People of big cities not mentally ill!!!!! BAD FILM,akiskard,10/29/2019,"Possibly the worst movie of the yearIf Hollywood has to give an award to Mr. Phoenix is never late to reconsider another film that made.why this film ?why this character ?Mental illness award ?at the end of the film, you don't know if all is fiction of the disrupt mind.SORRY TO PAID TO SEE THAT FILM"
10/10,Why all the concern from the professional reviewers? This movie is so good!,devolutionisreal-92464,10/18/2019,"No need for Deniro's name in ads. Phoenix IS the show. I am angry at so many negative reviews focusing on ""the violence"". Can't this just be a story? Does it have to teach some lesson? Does this have to include a discussion about mental health? Can't this just be a ""making of story"" about the most iconic villian in any comic universe? In the last 15 min when Arthur ""becomes"" , I found myself raising my arms, yes! As i walked out, I felt like i wanted to drive home at 90 mph! I loved this movie. I loved this film. I loved the director. I loved Joaquin. I didn't want to join any cause. I don't want to change my life. But days later, I am still amazed what a great movie this was!"
10/10,This is not some brain dead action movie this is a masterpiece!,zalanamd,10/7/2019,My expectations for this movie weren't very high (DC just has been lacking lately) but man this movie is a masterpiece that has to been seen by all.
8/10,"Great drama, with a stand-out performance from Joaquin Phoenix",grantss,10/4/2019,"Gotham City. Arthur Fleck works as a clown and is also an aspiring stand-up comic. He has mental health issues, part of which involves uncontrollable laughter. Times are tough and, due to his issues and occupation, Arthur has an even worse time than most. Over time these issues bear down on him, shaping his actions, making him ultimately take on the persona he is more known as...Joker.Great drama. While the movie fits into the Batman universe, and this could easily be seen as a prequel to Joker's character in The Dark Knight (where Joker was played superbly by Heath Ledger), this is not a comic-book movie. If it was a comic-book movie, it would have ended up another one in a long, seemingly endless line of them, one hardly discernible from the next.No, this is a human/psychological drama, and a very good one. Writer-director Todd Phillips creates a dark, depressing world with Arthur Fleck one of its primary casualties. The slow, inevitable progress of Arthur Fleck from innocent man to master-criminal is an interesting journey as Phillips rachets up the tension.What was then required was a performance that captured that darkness, helplessness and gradual disintegration and Joaquin Phoenix gives that, perfectly and spectacularly. Spot-on casting and delivery.Not quite the perfect movie though. Pacing was a bit off: some scenes seem dragged out too long. I know Phillips was drawing it out to create tension and atmosphere, but on a few occasions it feels like he overdoes it.It is also difficult, from a point, to be sympathetic towards Arthur Fleck. You start out supporting him, feeling that he is a victim rather than a villain, but, as his actions become more extreme, that engagement wanes.The story also feels like it is missing something to make it 100% complete. No, I'm not expecting this to link in with The Dark Knight. In fact, many of the Batman references actually seemed unnecessary, more there for audiences to gasp and say ""Oh, so that's how Joker fits in with Batman"", rather than adding anything to this story. A few scenes beyond the final scene might have been in order, to see more of Joker's history.Overall, still a great movie though."
1/10,Badly overhyped and poorly executed by all,gabriels-45483,10/15/2019,This was badly overhyped on all levels. Joaquin Phoenix whom I usually enjoy did not portray the man who became the Joker very well. Robert De Niro whom I normally love as well was just a twisted version of the late Johnny Carson. Worst of all was the directing job of Todd Phillips. He should not have taken on this movie. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME
1/10,Waste of money and time,alhaddadein_salah,10/13/2019,This movie won't be felt only by those who suffer and feel such feelings as the character does...It need some ill people mentally or physically who suffered during there life time to appreciate it.And from the rating I believe that a lot of ppl have experienced such circumstances hence the sympathy towards it.
10/10,Definitely an Oscar winning actor,loayoliva-73794,10/9/2019,"Wow ...what a movie and what an actor ,Go ahead and watch it, it really worth it,I've already seen it twice in three days."
2/10,A 'Triumph of the Will' for Nihilists,mjjusa-1,10/9/2019,"'Joker' is a sick, disgusting, dark, evil, violent, total piece of scheisse. It will seriously affect emotionally troubled young people already pulled at by suicide, addictive behaviors, and hopelessness. It's like a 'Triumph of the Will' for nihilists. I would defer from voting for Joaquin Phoenix for best actor until i see video of his normal non-acting self...it may be he wasn't acting in 'Joker' at all and is one majorly screwed up dude. And, what a weird alien body. He's naked from the waist up a lot in 'Joker' and, from the waist up, is, let's say, disquieting. All taut skin stretched tightly over an alien bone structure. The bones stick up and out at odd angles, in odd places, like the exoskeleton of a medical experiment gone wrong. Not a single pleasant moment in the movie. Not a moment of joy, nor beauty, nor happiness. No catharsis from all the misery and violence, just a stomach churning emptiness at the thought that the last fifty years have come down to this, and this is a circle of despair. A movie without hope, without humanity, showing a world that no sane person would live in."
10/10,Exceeded expectation by FAR,sunbuffett,10/4/2019,"Going into the theater I already had a very high expectation, but it was no where close to how good this movie and the acting actually is.... This movie is an art piece."
10/10,Flawless Storytelling,sopenco,10/4/2019,"Casting was really good. No crazy surprise breakaway performances - everybody fit their parts and held their own (which is hard in the face of Phoenix and DeNiro).But the way the story unfolds, the foreshadowing, the grand revelations - absolutely masterful! Nobody would ever expect such good writing to be invested in a comic book villain origin story, but alas..."
10/10,A comic film so real it feels imaginary,debashis-chin,10/4/2019,"As heath ledger's joker said ""madness is like gravity all you need is a push"" Joaquin through his performance has proved it. Through the movie one will witness the fall of a man and the rise of the Joker. Brilliant performance by Joaquin."

9/10,Beautiful. Haunting. Hard-hitting.,anvesh-mallick25,10/4/2019,JOKER review:A brilliant movie. Outstanding Phoenix. Genius Todd Phillips. BEAUTIFULLY HAUNTING.
1/10,Only echoes of the universe,blake_hampson,10/19/2019,"If you go to see this movie expecting the villain from the Batman universe, you won't find it. It is however a great movie about mental illness. Phoenix obviously studied the character quirks of people with schizophrenia. But the Joker should scare you, this guy just makes you uncomfortable. It doesn't AT ALL explain how an awkward loner turns into a charismatic criminal mastermind."

10/10,Incredible movie!,SeliusBlack,11/20/2019,"Hello,Firstly, I would like to say I create for the very first time an account here. And this is my first review after watching the movie. Sincerely, this is the best best movie of the year, and may be of the century.Some time ago, when the movie about Queen came out, my opinion was the same, and not long after, the film won almost all the Oscars.Best,"
10/10,A film to remember,haneenimadaim,11/20/2019,"I can't tell how I felt with every sense I watched,it was like take green cart to get in our deep side, and show us what is there! Jouqen is the most actor did his role in perfect way all the time. I watched movie twice before, and I'm waiting to watch it again"
10/10,A raw and unflinching movie about severe mental illness - with not a caped crusader in sight...,craigaconnelly1,11/20/2019,"Well, this movie completely blew me away. I suppose it will remain polarising to audiences due to the subject material, and the way it is presented. But don't be fooled into thinking that this is merely a superhero romp, or some similar variation. The core of this movie is an examination of severe mental illness, depicting a horrifying condition largely from the perspective of the sufferer. You are also given a birds-eye view of the world that surrounds such an illness. The consequences to other individuals and the wider community are portrayed with frightening accuracy and honesty. An understated and carefully crafted subplot, serves as an origin story to the supervillain... Stylistically, the movie is homage to Martin Scorsese, and you can't miss the nods to several of his gritty pieces. As well, I'm sure I felt the influence of other films too, such as 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' and 'Network'... Regarding Joaquin Phoenix's performance, I can't recall a more raw and gripping character portrayal. I reckon that this will come to be regarded as the definitive portrayal of severe mental illness by an actor on the silver screen. Phoenix has to be hands-down favourite for every upcoming major acting gong, and this is the best movie I've seen in a long time."
10/10,Favorite Movie of 2019,owllington,11/19/2019,"This movie was outstanding. Don't trust the critics, this movie is a masterpiece. I expected it to be good, but it far passed my expectations, and in my personal opinion I believe he's better than Heath Ledger."
8/10,Confused critics = good sign,domdalmasso,11/17/2019,"Tragedy either brakes a man or makes a man. But the Joker's Breakdown is more than mere tragedy. At a specific point in the story, it's a conscience choice. It's when he makes that free choice that the viewer no longer feels bad for him. When you change your philosophy to match how you feel (in the case of the Joker, to make morality subjective) you attack what makes human dignity objectively good. An opponent to human dignity is not subject to sympathy. The Joker is evil.This is a commentary on the ""victim mindset"" that we see in today's political-correctness. Batman is the contrast. His hardships make him want to spread justice. The joker's hardships make him want to spread more hardships."
9/10,Cinema_beast review,kotsiosg-65958,11/17/2019,"As one falls, another rises. The more I think about the movie, the less I have to say. This review was very difficult to write since I'd constantly get overwhelmed and lost in my thoughts. This film makes you think. A lot. It's the only thing I can think about and I can confidently say; it has 'scarred me'. The message it tells is relevant and very important since it's a realistic interpretation of where our society could end up. It's a warning which needs to be heard. Phillips makes an Oscar worthy, unique film. A film usually has high and low points which it fluctuates about. However, this film is steadily in the middle, creating tension throughout. Phillips makes the film fascinating and intriguing even though it's slow. The arc of Arthur is also organic and very well written since by the end you feel as if it was bound to happen. Phoenix's performance is also Oscar worthy since he is able to make us pity but fear him. Basically he's amazing. I'm still overwhelmed and trying to piece things together so that's all I have to say. In conclusion, it wouldn't be a surprise if it got a best picture and actor nomination. It's amazing and definitely one of my favorite films of all time."
10/10,A goddamn masterpiece,hanna-94032,11/10/2019,"If you're here for a joker story this is not for you. It's a character development movie. The trailer tells you exactly what the movie is about. It's a bout Arthur Fleck becoming the joker. But that's not why it's great. It's great because Hawken Phoenix shows you how a person changes. Everything is rooted in reality and everything that happens is very beliveable not because what is actually happening is believeable but because Arthur believes it to be. This is a great movie that can be interperated to eternity. Director Todd Phillips really went for gold here. He created an amazing universe which this movie can exist in. You don't know if any of the things that happens really happened or if it's just in Arthur's head. Damn everyone should se this movie. I've seen it 3 times in cinema, but I want to see it again. It's just that good. It's art in its truest form."
10/10,WOW,kjverlind,11/10/2019,"Wow, just WOW!Mindblowing performance by Joaquin Phoenix! Mindblowing movie!Nothing more to add."
10/10,Powerful and very emotive.,dv_h,11/9/2019,"Probably the most intense film I've watched but maybe for personal reasons.This film goes deep and can be quite uncomfortable.The acting is sublime and the cinematography is beautiful but basic.This film has left an everlasting mark on me, more than any film I've watched before, in good and bad ways.It'll be a while before I feel comfortable to watch it again (but I will)Some of the low scoring reviews on here are hilarious and look like they're written by 5 year old who'd expected to an Avengers movie.This film is massively thought provoking and is an absolute must for fans of cinema.Outstandingly edgy without being pretentious."
10/10,One Word Describes this film... Masterpiece,lilbuch22,11/9/2019,"As a kid growing up Joker was my favorite superhero villain and I always enjoyed seeing the different ways he was portrayed as. That being said, nothing tops this film. Phoenix gives one of the best performances of any film I have ever seen in my life. The writing is absolutely enchanting, dark, tight and extremely engaging. This movie blends psychological thriller, with crime mystery, and overall dark drama. The original score is about as perfectly made for a film as it can possibly get. Whenever it came on I notice the effect of the slow burn increasing suspense my heart rate would increase. The pacing in this movie is just fantastic, it flys by so quickly. I am still taking everything in, the symbolic elements, the meaning of it all and the ending especially the ending which is worth the price of admission. Joker is an extremely dark, and emotionally intense film that really is a lot to take in but it is so well done. Masterpiece!!!! Oscars make sure you watch this film and give it the awards it deserves!!!"
10/10,This movie is hauntingly beautiful.,zamanismam,11/8/2019,"When I went to the theatre to see this movie, I was expecting an ordinary movie about a DC villian. But what I saw was way, way more than that. Not only does it show Joker's origin but also shows how society treats people who are a bit different from them. Todd Phillips did an amazing job presenting the little details that show Aurther Fleck's degrading mentality. And the way the music and camera shots emphasises that idea is nothing short of remarkable. Joaquin Phoenix delivered an oscar-winning performance, which made the movie something I will remember for the rest of my life."
10/10,It is scary to cheer for the twisted ones,evenamit,10/31/2019,"Let's ignore the phenomenal acting, directing, script, filmography, special effects etc.. You could read about those elements anywhere else.People hate or worship the Joker movie for the same reason, on its superficial level, it glorifies the madmen, the lost, the pillars of capitalism that went astray and as a viewer you might do the same, asking yourself, should I hate the Batman now? No, you are not crazy.It seems that due to non-biological, cultural-related life circumstances, the only way that Arthur Fleck could fulfill himself is to become the Joker, a title that is a part of the movie's strongest underlying, Arthur didn't choose his destiny or his new name and identity, society's strongest did and it seems like there are many people like him or at least people that identify with him as seen in the street of Gotham in the last hour of the movie.I will watch this movie as many times as I watched Pulp Fiction, maybe more, and to think that there is only one significant character in it ( OK maybe De Niro's character is important, but they are all important)"
10/10,PHENOMENAL,ramtrishan,10/24/2019,"The performance of joaquin phoenix is a masterpiece. If he doesn't get an oscar for this than I don't know wat is oscar worthy. You would't expect this from Todd Phillips, but he made a masterpiece."
10/10,Madness of cinematic,ahmdmadridista,10/24/2019,Unbelievable how come we love the bad guy after living their own life
10/10,Darker Than Dark!,thekissinggirls,10/24/2019,I actually really didn't want to like this film and thought I was going to find it awful to watch. Instead I found it to be brilliant. So deeply disturbing and had me on totally gripped throughout. Amazing film and so well done. I usually don't like Phoenix but he is so good in this and really gets it bang on. Thanks for making this film!
10/10,What a movie...,goudelock,10/24/2019,"Joker actually is a mix of different genres and elements who create something unique.You can see the Taxi Driver or King of Comedy influences but Todd Phillips Movie has more things to say ... and Joaquin's Phoenix performance helps him to do that 100 %.I think it's the best character development I've see in a movie and the screenplay it's artistic written. Even if doesn't follow the comic mythology at all and it's very realistic and less comic book movie, Joker has a lot of elements of Batman Mythology and gives some hint to DC fans. Dark, brutal, funny and sad at the same time ... Joker is one of the best movies of the recent years."
10/10,Incredible film,lhorgan-26405,10/24/2019,"I havent been this satisfied by a movie in a long time. There was so much depth and relatability. Joaquin did a fantastic job portraying such a real, broken character"
10/10,It was great!,Adam_Isaksson,10/23/2019,Saw it on opening day in Sweden and loved all of it.
10/10,Comic book story telling for adults and intellectuals,mrlowestudios,10/23/2019,"Great performances from all involved. Phillips is awesome with telling the story he wanted and leaving room for interpretation. Expressing his own feelings of society. Conveying it through the tragic story of a person having been beaten by society, now choosing the wrong path. Letting go and giving into his own sick and twisted perspective of the world that treated him so brutally. Returning the hate and anger bestowed upon him. It's sad and wonderful, mischievous and marvelous all at the same time. As an avid comic book, movie , joker, nerd. I felt Joaquin captured his darkness that grew from innocence to violence. His quirks and ticks are exactly what I imagined a live Joker to be, without being cheesy. you see him immerse himself into the madness that lives with the Joker and becomes apart of you as you follow the rabbit hole of the joker. Great stuff, fascinating approach."
10/10,Don't see it as a DC film.,jamesalde-04007,10/22/2019,"Focus on Arthur. This film is on point with what they want told. I've seen movies that deals with the same idea, but this is just a lecture.A very human society revolves around Arthur and sends him down a path full of conflicts and challenges. To understand why this representation of society can be considered normal, you have to see that this is what our contemporary generation has led to. Everything in this film is normal, normal because it happens and happened. We try to prevent it but its so normalized that it still happens. The problem isn't because of having either mental issues or normal issues, its the fact that we consider them two different things, and forget that the simple concept was to comfort the ones who are going through tough times, and just be there for them.We have opened a network of wrongs and it will keep on breeding more wrongs, until we choose to stop and do something about it."
10/10,Joker Gets In Your Head & Never Leaves,xclbr,10/21/2019,"Joker's like getting in a time machine and going back to 1983 and watching a movie that was made without modern restraints to be thought provoking & entertaining, definitely NOT made to be PC, LGBT or appeal specifically to the Chinese or any minority. Joker was made for all mankind. The bought and paid for mainstream media critics will hate Joker, but true film fans will leave having seen something unapologetically original and unimaginably enjoyable. Joker resembles Taxi Driver or Platoon for getting in your head with brutal honesty and never leaving."
10/10,"On So Many Levels, In So Many Ways JOKER Is Cinema PERFECTION!",missreneb,10/21/2019,"I have to fan geek out on this FILM! It is simply one of the most perfect efforts in cinema ever. If JOKER does not rake in awards or more specifically multiple Oscars I will be befuddled! Joaquin Phoenix always delivers a masterful performance in all of his movies however this performance is truly magnificent. I was spellbound by him and by so much more. This music is phenomenal and high praises to Hildur Guðnadóttir!!!!! I will be seeking this brilliant composer to listen more of. Lawrence Shers' cinematography was beautiful and the film color/saturation was so spot on!!! KUDOS! Editing? Beautifully done!!!! Thanks to Jeff Groth and his team if he has one! I could keep singing about this movie but I will spare everyone....but damn, the man who brought it all together, director Todd Phillips. Masterful job!!!!! I wanted to stand up and cheer during the credits.... :) LOVED IT!"
10/10,Unbelievable!,DingoDiablo,10/21/2019,"So I made an account and I am about to give my first ever movie review because of this film.I'm not a critic and Don't know much about the intricacies of cinema but what I can say is this is a damn good movie, I've never watched a movie so perfect before in my life. Honestly I thought this movie was gonna be a flop but I've never been so glad to be wrong.First off this is a terrifyingly real depiction of mental health, I have depression and was nearly in tears multiple times through this movie because I could feel everything that brought the character Arthur down. My favourite thing about this movie is the music, it's a truly scary score that blends well with the overall tone of the movie, every time you hear the music play you get an overpowering sense of dread and fear of what's about to happen. The violence hits hard but isn't over the top and makes you wonder what more this character is capable of. Never before have I seen pacing so perfect in film, it goes from 0 to 100 so slowly yet so quickly making you realise just how serious Arthur's mental state really is. The only thing wrong with this movie is the feeling of needing more!In the end Joker is the best film I have ever seen, it hits hard and leaves you wanting more from Joaquin Phoenix's exceptional performance that haunted my thoughts for days, I've been to see it 3 times now and my thoughts haven't changed. I truly hope to see this iteration of the Joker again in a sequel or even a cameo for any future projects. Hats off to the director and every person involved in this film, it was beyond perfect!"
10/10,Holy Cesar Romero's Moustache...!,TwittingOnTrender,10/21/2019,"I always go to the one-star reviews first, as the ten star reviews of movies I like will just echo what I think. I like to see what someone who DIDN'T like the movie has to say - ""OK, convince me"".The one-star reviews are hilarious - they range from the ""I'm different to everyone else!"" cries for attention to the jealous, possessive moans of those people who think that THEIR character or story has been taken from them and turned into something they don't like. Basically no-one convinced me - I didn't read a single thing that maybe think ""Hmm, maybe they have a point. I hadn't noticed that"".For this is a perfect movie. Even to a superhero agnostic like me. The performance of Joaquin Phoenix beggars belief - from his physical transformation to the acting turn he puts in. I can't imagine anyone in the history of acting portraying this character to such devastating effect. I won't go on, because, as I said, it has all been said in other reviews - suffice to say that I'll be amazed if another movie tops this in my view in 2019. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood might have run it close with 20 minutes shaved off but as it stands, Joker reigns supreme, awards season notwithstanding.I wondered why the left had took agin this movie, which is no more or less violent than many movies, superhero or no. (And speaking of Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, I heard someone on a podcast say they walked out when someone started inflicting violence on a woman. (This was a woman intent on slaughtering people, including an unborn child) So you waited till ten minutes from the end to stage your big protest!?) Then I found out. Apparently Todd Phillips said ""Woke culture has killed comedy"". Big mistake! The memo went out. The Hive Mind was apprised. Nothing he did was ever to be favourably reviewed again. Good. More room in the cinema for me."
10/10,This movie is truly a masterpiece.,elmahk,10/18/2019,"I have never in my life felt a movie like I did the joker. This movie is truly a masterpiece and it made me feel something I have never felt before. I cant stop thinking about the movie after I watched it yesterday I am just completely blown away. The music, the actor, the story.. Truly something else. My expectations were so high for this movie and the movie was far better then I ever imagined. Jesus Christ if you haven't seen this movie you are in for a treat. Im gonna go watch it again bye."
10/10,Amazing,sm_adnan2002,10/13/2019,A Masterpiece thanks to Phoenix. I don't know whether they should make a sequel or not but this one is must to watch
10/10,Masterpiece,lulojem,10/13/2019,"A genuine interpretation from Joaquin take us to feel the empathy and the deep pain he goes into.... amazing actor who transmit very well every emotion and stage he goes thru. Some people claiming the movie was odd, too dark and pacing but, in my opinion The odd and pacing on this movie was necessary for the public to understand what is mental illness. Photography, sound track and direction is delightful. Definily a must own movie, watched for second time already and I will many more. Bravo 👏🏻 and grateful for this movie, I do celebrate the success of this amazing film. Well deserved."
10/10,"Mind blowing, fantastic",thesaini,10/13/2019,I was enough sure that this will give me some unforgettable moments but things get really amazing when i finally saw it and I was like i need 1 or 2 minutes to think about what was just happened in the scene. I mean how can a person go deep into these scene for some fraction of second and suddenly newer trench waiting for you. So unbelievable. Iam happy and thanks god to keep me alive so that i am able to see this cinema
10/10,Amazing,bjonesdk,10/13/2019,"Incredible performanceCan strongly recommend the movie, even if you disliked the precious films."
10/10,don't miss it,bader-a,10/13/2019,One of the best film I have ever seen in my life 🔥🔥🔥
10/10,a work of art that meets your expectations and left me impacted from beginning to end,patitapatas,10/13/2019,"I am not a fan of the dd batman universe, I am never interested, but they recommended the movie and I do not regret those 122 minutes I spent watching this magnificent piece of art. The direction, photography and lighting is brutal and accompanies the progress and development of the plot and the character. Phoenix played the joker spectacularly and magnificently, I loved his performance and I found the best selection. The development of the joker and his thankfulness is incredible, his important moments were well managed and he loved everything about him. Frances conroy great as always. If you did not see it, watch it, even if you are not a fan or have not seen other movies, just watch it, because it is not essential. One of the best movies of the year"
10/10,A movie so unlike the movies of today. Truly a Masterpiece.,alexhogendorp,10/13/2019,"This ain't no ordinary superhero movie. Never have I expected to tear up watching a movie especially in this day and age. The writing and character development is done extremely well, have I ever feel the pain The Joker goes through in this life. How his relation of his surroundings I compare to my relations with leftists elites like Silicon Valley and corrupt governments of western Europe to nihilists who infest the western world. That feel of wanting to change absolutely everything and how satisfying it would feel if you've actually achieve this stance of changing the landscape around you. Albeit my goals are a permanent renaissance, A permanent nirvana for the shreds of sanity of humanity, being the innocent ones, the ones unlike the ignorant normies and the scummy elitists who tear the world apart. Never have I expected a movie made in recent times have I ever felt shocked or uncomfortable in a good way. A movie to really inspire me especially at this magnitude is extremely hard to come across. Like The Matrix, it should really get you to grasp on an extremely interesting perspective of the world. A movie to really challenge you on what you perceive in life. This is one epic masterpiece if I've ever seen one."
10/10,Deeply disturbing and brutal,djohnson-52,10/12/2019,"This film is far removed from the comic book capers one would initially expect. There is no superhero action sequences here. This is a psychologically thrilling yet disturbingly shocking version of The Joker, maybe a character study if you will.There is no falling into chemical waste in this movie; what you get here isn't a physical destruction of the character but a mental one. This could be a film of The Joker's psyche rather than his story.Phoenix's portrayal is nothing short of amazing. At times I felt like he may have tried too hard, but regardless this is an award winning performance and it's clear that he has thrown everything into this character both mentally and physically.Coupled with a beautiful soundtrack and amazing photography and direction this is a true masterpiece.Personally I'd rate this as the best entrant into the Gotham City universe so far. To follow this going to be insanely difficult.A movie that is, at times, cringeworthy yet still keeps you mesmerised. This is a sickly sweet, brutal and deeply dark and disturbing film. There is no good versus evil here; there is only pure evil. This franchise has finally come of age."
10/10,Outstanding,ms-98821,10/12/2019,"As an avid movie watcher, I can't help but get bothered by the amount of people comparing the jokers from the latest film to the one in Dark Knight. Let me first clear the fact that I think Heath Ledger's performance in the dark knight set the bar extremely high for anyone that was to play the role again, this was clear from the miserable attempt by Jared Leto in suicide squad.The joker in the latest instalment is about how he became the joker and the revelations of his childhood trauma and mental illness, it's the back story to everything you've ever seen about a joker. It is stupidly wrong for anyone to compare him to the Joker from the dark knight, where we see a matured chaotic version, a finished product more or less.This movie was not supposed to tell you a story with a begging middle and end, it doesn't have a very sold narrative nor it's supposed to be a fast paced watch. There's nothing wrong with that and I honestly don't think that's what they were going for. It portrays his existing struggle with his illness, his failed career aspirations and the harshness of the society he's in. The movie is about him and him only, the uprising of the joker everyone knew before this movie.If you're still bothered by the story then let the cinematography and sounds effects sink in for a moment.My final opinion is about the acting, it is one of the most original and convincing roles I've ever seen in a film, every move combined with his body language, tone and that horrific laughter captured my attention, which gave me goosebumpsIf Heath Ledger was alive today, he'd most certainly be proud of Joaquin's acting"
10/10,Absolutely fantastic!,nejcnemcek-01404,10/11/2019,Absolutely fantastic!
10/10,Best Since the Dark Knight,nicholaslacorte,10/10/2019,"One of the best films since the Dark Knight trilogy came out. So incredibly profound that I left the theater appreciating it more and more as I couldn't stop thinking about all the subtleties in the script and acting that made it perfect. I've never seen another movie like it. Going to see it again soon and will buy the blu-Ray when it's released. I had high expectations and it exceeded them. Do not listen to the critics and do not think ""it's just hype"" go see it for your self and see how incredible this masterpiece truly is."
10/10,For watch so many times,manx-48234,10/8/2019,This movie is a really art work! It's amazing! The best of 2019! Joaquin Phoenix always be live in our hearts
10/10,Amazing performance by Joaquin Phoenix!,talhafarid,10/7/2019,"This was just brilliant! It's been a long time since I enjoyed a DC film. Got no words, Joaquin deserves an Oscar for his performance as the Joker."
10/10,Incredible Oscar-worthy movie,charleshthompson-86934,10/6/2019,Did the Critics watch the same movie as everyone else?
10/10,Masterpiece,miketikas-45875,10/5/2019,Thats the first time in my life i made an account here just so i can rate this movie 10/10
10/10,Completely beautiful masterpiece!,josephmuller,10/5/2019,I made an account because of this movie. I loved every second of it. This is the best actor to ever grace DC I almost find it impossible to believe they'll keep the quality up after this movie. I laugh at the controversies surrounding this by people with no clue as to what mental illness is or lack the capacity to know the spectrum it covers. See this movie. You will walk away having been impacted by one thing or the other.
10/10,Best movie in 2019,rvd-26704,10/5/2019,Best movie in 2019.Just watch it...really awesome..
10/10,Simply just astonishing,gabornagy81,10/5/2019,"In my opinion this movie should be the example for future films, because it proved that good movies can be created without cgi. This movie contains a profound character, and plot. Furthermore, Joaquin Phoenix's play is exceptional, and his devotion for this role can not be ignored. I can recommend it to those, who want to know the origin of Joker."
10/10,Joaquin Phoenix does the role of his life.,benjilundback,10/4/2019,"It's a masterpiece. Simple as that. Joaquin does the role of his life in this movie. It felt so real, Arthur really is a troubled man and boy did we get the perfect man to play him. The writing and directing is also amazing, Todd Phillips really makes you feel the Scorsese-Taxi Driver vibes. It's so dark and it makes you sympathize with Arthur when you really shouldn't in a way.I am going to watch it again, for sure. Easily one of my favorite movies of all time. This will be a classic."
10/10,One of the greatest Masterpieces ever ?,jonniebubble,10/3/2019,"When I sat to watch the Joker , I was anxious because as a person I do not like comic book movies . It's just my taste . I really don't find those movies so important because most of the times , they do not transmit a message . However , my opinion changed when I viewed the Joker . Personally , I do not think that this movie is a comic book one . It is a drama that shows the tragic life of an ordinary individual , who is disregarded by the society around him . From a specific point of view , you feel sorry for him and you really want to blame the rich and powerful who have created a societal trap that helps them achieve their personal goals while ordinary people suffer every day . From another perspective however , you are scared and terrified by his reaction to all this misery that society brings to him . That's what this movie perfectly does . It creates a story that is split in two subjective realities . The distorted reality of Arthur Fleck that is influenced greatly by his mental illness and the reality through the eyes of the common people that blame his actions . It is a story that depends on how the viewer wants to see it . But I think that the story really shows the life of a man who did the wrong things and reacted in a psychopathic way to his problems , partly because of his mental illness and partly because of the pressure that was created by the environment around him . It is a story that does not justify this guy , but also does not accuse him . It just shows us that we , as a whole , sometimes create a Joker , without often realising it . So , for me it is a presentation of the two sides of the same story , those of an unstable and poor individual in a cruel dystopian city that does not care for people like him and those of the people with common sense . Additionally , it wants to tell people that they should take care of men and women who have mental problems and they should fight for a better world that does not treat the unprivileged so harshly as it does ."
10/10,This is the best,what-da-puck,10/3/2019,Best of overall movie. I very don't know what to say but you really need to see this movie.
10/10,One of the most fascinating and engrossing films ever made,tse323,10/26/2019,"Joker is absolutely brilliant. It's gritty and utterly captivating. It's a tough watch at times and yet you can't look away. I would not recommend it for the faint of heart, but if you love crime drama, 1970s movies, or very early Scorsese films you might enjoy Joker. The film is getting a tough rap from the mainstream critics, mainly because it's very divisive, but also because it shines a harsh light on some very rough subjects, including class warfare, access to health care, and the mental health crisis in America. If any of these things make you uncomfortable don't go see this film. As for my opinion, Joaquin Phoenix deserves an Oscar and so does the director. Yeah, it's that good.One last thing, the photography demands that you see it in the best possible quality. Also, for goodness sake, don't let your kids see this movie. This is not a Batman film. This is not a Marvel popcorn movie. It's a ""hard R"" crime drama."
10/10,People don't understand it.,schweigjermaine,10/15/2019,"Some people say that it is too dark for their likings, and made them uncomfortable. That's the point of the movie. It let's you litterly stand in the shoes of a mentally ill man. If you don't understand the movie then you should probably not even review it because if you missed the movie's mark all what will come out of your mouth is bull bull."
10/10,Greatest movie of ALL TIME!,khanr-51919,10/12/2019,What a performance by Joaquin. The way they build the character is mind blowing! Loved Heath Ledger but Joaquin has actually outdone him here...
10/10,A true masterpiece!,samanehdds,10/11/2019,"I'm not a fan of Batman movies but went to see this with my teenage son. It's truly one of the best movies I have ever seen. I have never felt a movie to be PERFECT, but this movie truly I s. They just don't make movies like this anymore with the perfect story, script, cinematography, score, acting! It will be revered as a cinematic masterpiece.And I do appreciate the political statement it's making. It's not condoning violence. It's trying to reveal what harm mental illness which is ignored by society and even bullied and ridiculed can do.Just saw it for a second time tonight! Will watch again!"
10/10,Is there any way to rate this movie more than 10 stars?,fahimalvi,10/7/2019,"What can I say? This movie speaks for itself. It's amazing, it's mesmerizing, it's dark, it's brutal, it's the best movie of 2019 hands down. At first we see the sufferings of the main character Arthur Fleck. Then we see his journey into madness and accepting his identity, Joker. The ending was magnificent. It's a movie you just have to see to experience how good it actually is."
10/10,Masterpiece,alexanderwilkinson-94498,10/7/2019,In a time of over saturated comic book movies it's a beautiful irony that this is the film currently attempting to push boundaries in the genre and break out of the comedy infused entertainment formula we have had for the last decade is the one film about a clown.
10/10,"If anyone is deserving of an Oscar, it's Joaquin Phoenix",phoebetrembath,10/7/2019,"Even if you are not a fan of dark, psychological thrillers, there is no denying that Phoenix has set a whole new standard for the acting world. Phoenix portrays the joker like never before, leaving the audience to pity the character. I have seen the movie twice since it's release date on Friday, and can say with confidence that it is an instant classic for sure. It opens up new doors for film and actors. Arguably the best acting of the past decade."

10/10,A MASTERPIECE 💯,sakram-06454,10/9/2019,This joker Standalone movie is a Masterpiece and the acting of Joaquin Pheonix makes it Oscar Worthy. I think it would be unfair if this movie and Joaquin doesn't gets the oscar.
7/10,Way too many 10s. This was a technical masterpiece and Phoenix was great.,TheUserIDYouEnteredHasAlready,10/4/2019,"But the 10 star reviews that came flooding in were too much for me to take seriously, and I was right.By all means, go see Joker - it's a standalone origin story that needs no knowledge of the Batman series, but it also rewards fans of that series with some very convincing details and very believable storytelling.I won't get into the plot, but there are some twists. Very well done, in fact, even though they are both reminiscent of certain M. Knight Shymalan films. Very tastefully done and expertly integrated into the storyline without overindulgence and quite important for the story and character arcs at play. Bravo in that respect.Also, applause for the cinematography, the style, the homages to previous classics and just the wonderfully realistic atmosphere that the director and his crew were able to bring to life here. Positively the most believable and realistic Gotham ever. Some might find that to be a veiled critique, but it makes this film watchable and enjoyable by those who have no knowledge of the Batman franchise(s).Just altogether airtight production and direction. Hands down.The only gripe I have is with the score - not the songs, necessarily, but the use of over-dramatic violin/cello passages and too-loud unnecessary (and very dark) orchestral pieces that almost take the audience out of the experience. Those who have seen it may know what I am talking about, but no spoilers.All in all, this is very much worth watching even if I feel as though it may spawn some copycats in real life - sure to have a long ""cult film"" life after it fades from the cinemas.7.5/10 with no caveats."
1/10,So overrated,milad93x,10/19/2019,"I found nothing interesting or artistic about this movie, it's just a meaningless show which pretends something meaningful"
10/10,The rundown on why people may or may not like the movie,josephcohen,10/7/2019,"I loved the movie and believe it is one of my personal favorites ever, but many people are giving it bad reviews. This movie will please those who understand it and see the underlying messages, which makes it powerful, moving, entertaining, and real. But if you don't see the true meaning (or don't want to), it just seems like an unnecessarily dark and violent addition to the Batman ""franshise"". Another reason some people may dislike this movie and find it ""boring and too slow"" is because there is an extraordinary lack of CGI, which for me personally makes it all the better... and then some. If this sounds like a negative to you, please stick to The Avengers and don't waste your time, because you will. It's not cookie cutter, it's not a money grab, it's a movie that makes you think and can be perceived in many ways. Exceptional writing and a surreal acting performance turns this would-be great movie into something truly special.There isn't a right way for Joker to be perceived, there is just a wrong way, and that's where the bad reviews come from, expecting something it was never meant to be, while missing/overlooking the greatness of this film."
10/10,Amazing !,lauraallen-56530,10/6/2019,So so good! Incredibly dark and intense. Brilliantly acted! The best film I've seen in a long time! Well done Joaquin!
10/10,Rare occasion when the hype/buzz/comparisons are correct - Fantastic!,matthewbardeleben,10/6/2019,"I personally loved the film but, let's be honest, you don't care what I think.Why would you... you don't even know me.No, YOU want to know if YOU'LL like the film and are looking for signs (occasionally hidden deep inside an ocean of egocentric opinions) as to whether or not you will.The answers simple.If you want, or are expecting, ANY semblance of a ""comic book"" movie there's a good chance you'll be disappointed. It's not. And it doesn't attempt to be.The common comparison of ""If you like Taxi Driver, you'll love this"" is over-simplified yet astoundingly accurate.It's true. If you're a fan of Taxi Driver, or similar films, you'll be right at home laughing (when you shouldn't be) along with Joker.The acting's outstanding across the board. Cinematography is absolutely fantastic. Everything from set design to editing add to the fact we now have another (rare) classic-in-the-waiting film that happens to draw from a comic book series."
10/10,Masterpiece especially in IMAX - The audience applauded!,UniqueParticle,10/4/2019,"Best Joker adaption ever, everything dark you'd want from such a character and I smiled throughout! Well worth every penny. Perfect amount of madness and incredible soundtrack. I don't even have complaints I am very satisfied - I absolutely love the profoundness in it. Joaquin Phoenix and Health Ledger are the best Jokers we'll have. I really hope this get nominated for the Oscars I'd dance a wild jig! Also this is my 550th review which is really cool!"
10/10,Joker movie we deserve,darrian-zellman-913-210017,10/13/2019,"Amazing acting from Phoenix!!! Absolutely solid performance. The score was equally incredible. My only complaint was there was a lot of build up time to becoming Joker, not a lot of Joker time. I understand this is an origin story, I just feel that I wanted a bit more in the end. But all in all amazing movie, you must go see it!"
10/10,TRULY A MASTERPIECE,boss_dany,10/6/2019,"All the props to the team that made this fantastic movie. I have no words to express how i'm feeling about this movie, it was shocking, terifying and beautiful at the same time. I had high expectations about this movie and it delivered! The only movie i was not mad that i paid to see it in theatre. I don't know who are those people that the news say they walked out of the theatre because Joker was bad, or too violet, but they have no idea what they are talking about. This movie is perfect, from every scene, the cinematografy, the acting, the lighting, and omg, the MUSIC. 10/10 Best movie i've seen in the last 10 years. Give it a chance, don't let negative reviews fool you, you should watch it and decide for yourself it it's good or no."
1/10,"Just like great painting art in in the eye of the beholder, guess I need glasses but i don't think so.",chiefconsultant,10/14/2019,"I have seen Jokers and this is not my joker. I know lots of reviewers gave this a 10 out of 10 score yet I almost walked out of the movie. It had no greatness for me. Phoenix did a great performance but it become too repetitious for me. Also, this guy had to have lost a lot of weight as he showed a shockingly thin body. I will say I enjoyed the credits at the end. The yellow lettering against the black background allowed for clean clear reading of all who worked on this movie. As the only dissenter in the reviews I am sure most will believe the others. Sorry just was not my cup of tea."
9/10,"Beautiful cinematography, slow and steady build up with intense character development",kraussersirwolf,10/4/2019,"Such a different kind of film it's hard to describe, but I'll try. Dark, twisted, humanly relatable, psychotic realism from the point of view of an impoverished society letting its citizens fall through the gaps. It's the perfect combination of uncomfortable, awkward, sad, and funny. I'm pretty sure I felt new untapped emotions without current names, like discovering a new species of animal. It's a work or art, not a super hero of anti-hero movie. Many will be disappointing, as a little of me was, but most of me was very very satisfied. Don't walk there with any expectations, just an open pallet and soak up the paint as it's brushed."
9/10,"A month ago ""Tarantino"" and now ""Joker"". Cinema makes me happy",nitranil,10/15/2019,Hildur Guðnadóttir thank you for the amazing soundtrack!!!Joaquin Phoenix is outstanding. The Joker from a completely different perspective.He laughs and at the same time he can show all kinds of emotions with his eyes.Just incredible.
10/10,Masterpiece.,stephenandrewmarti,10/12/2019,I'm 47. I've been around. I've been to the cinema a LOT. Never been to see a film twice though. Joker I've seen 3 times it is THAT good. Well to me anyway.
10/10,"A perfect film that is so entertaining, so emotionally and psychologically touching and so thought provoking!",atheeralkhalfa,10/9/2019,"I couldn't care any less about comics and I went into this blind without knowing about any of the hype expecting a ""meh"" movie. This is now my favourite movie of all time. It is one of those movies that makes you want to run back home to search for any scenes that might be available on the net and re-watch them again and again. Every scene is so powerful, gripping and fresh. The music, acting, dancing and cinematography is mesmerising. ""Joker"" is a masterpiece."
10/10,Will Hopefully Be Talked About for a Long Time,jakebarbarash,10/9/2019,"This masterpiece of a film shows how, one sort of small Director and one of the best actors of all time can come together to make a movie that reflects society in the past but also today in some of the worst ways possible.With the director, Todd Phillips, that did movies like the Hangover and Old School he shows that not only can he make very funny comedies but also a dark and serious period film. He's camera work throughout the entire film with over the shoulder shots and tracking shots of characters show how much he cared about the style and the feel of the 1980's Gotham setting.The stand out of the entire film was Joaquin Phoenix's performance of the titular character of The Joker, but it doesn't feel like he is playing a Joker that we have ever scene before. We know the look of him and we know what his name is but his back story and many unique aspects to the character such as his laugh, and his voice are very different. Joaquin Phoenix seems to know that he is playing Arthur Fleck more than he is playing The Joker. By losing 50 lbs and learning dance moves and practicing the laugh of people with Pathological Laughter shows how much he cared about this role and the challenge it took for him to become The Joker and Arthur Fleck.This movie as a whole is a period film and a character study. It shows how society is today with corruption and looking out the little guy. It shows how people can be treated so poorly and not cared about. It shows the dangers of what can come when things are slowly taken away from a person in their life. It also shows how mental illness can affect a person and their outlook on life. One quote is ""what do you get when you cross a mentally ill loner with a society that abandons him and treats him like trash?"". This perfectly sums up how society can warp the mind of someone especially someone with a mental illness.This movie deserves all the praise it's getting and will hopefully be talked about for years to come."
10/10,Best film I've ever seen in a cinema,jasm_it,10/8/2019,"Hands down. Oscar worthy on many fronts. Phoenix really raised the bar on Joker with a stellar performance. Critics are out of touch, partisan, narrative pushers who couldn't review anything objectively if their life depended on it. Off to their beloved gulags with them and into the cinema you go."
10/10,No wonder critics are afraid of it.,adiaquakaka,10/7/2019,"See. Its been such a long time since there has been a movie which is not supposed to make you feel happy or just give you moments. I am so happy that I got to witness this and see it. It will hit your soul. It will make you ask questions. It will make you think so hard, which is something we don't get in movies anymore.Also, even though this is called ""Joker"", I hope people don't forget about Arthur, because I think that's what's important. The journey of Arthur to whatever he becomes.I am glad I am alive in 2019 to witness this masterpiece."
10/10,The Academy owes Phoenix an Oscar for this role,jorgemartinezmd,10/7/2019,"Everyone is talking about how violent and disturbing this film is... well, what's violent and disturbing is the REAL WORLD out there!!! American politics must change!! That's the message!! That's the films critic to society!! Mental health needs to be addressed!! Guns must be regulated!!Congratulations to the team who make this masterpiece possible and without any doubt the best performance of Joaquín Phoenix in any roll and the best Joker characterization of all time."

Joaquin performance is outstanding but it's not as good as heath's one.It's one of those movies that it's totally worth it to go see it on a cinema. The intense songs when gooes louder it makes a good and dark feeling into it. A fantastic movie, and an incredible performance by Joaquin."

10/10,Mesmerizing and Disturbing at the same time!,raja-mishra7,10/6/2019,"If I have to speak about acting after you have scrolled down the star cast section, I would do a disservice to the actors and the director.So, we would talk about the outstanding story, wonderful script writing, surprising cinematography and marvelous character development- things that we do not talk about that often.This movie shows how you can make a Shawshank Redemption kind of film from a comic book character.Make Todd Phillips the creative head of DCEU and you will have more such masterpieces."
10/10,For Joaquin Phoenix,gautamissharma,10/6/2019,"This movie is nothing but showcase of Joaquin Phoenix acting skills. He took whole movie on his shoulders.And That laugh. You will get goosebumps, everytime he laughs."

Go and watch."
10/10,Masterpiece give us Joker 2,rbasrawi,10/3/2019,The ending gave me a straight minute of goosebumps the story is spot on the acting is just wow i cant rate this at 10 as it deserves more i hope we can get joker 2 with the same actor he was super great. Great movie with great music.
10/10,"One character, one movie and more substance than the whole MCU",mreverybody,10/12/2019,Phoenix provides the best acting ever. It's not the movie of the it's the movie of the DECADE.
10/10,"Uncomfortable, affecting, triumphant, dark",drael64,10/11/2019,"This movie will affect you. It speaks to society, it speaks to the human condition, it speaks to our darker instincts. It's gritty, human, and in some small way profound.It's beautifully shot, artistic, very well acted, the the score is absolutely effective and well done. I don't rate this 10 lightly. It's not a film to be merely entertained, but it is a ride, and it's a film to talk about. See it, it's rare something like this comes along."
10/10,Best movie in 2019,abofahad006,10/10/2019,Joaquin Phoenix transform to the jokerBest actor in 2019Amazing ending and no stupid girl clown to ruined the movie hope for joker 2
10/10,Just amazing,santerixdxd,10/9/2019,Do I have to say more? It's everything I thought it would be. This is tye jest movie of 2019.
10/10,Masterpiece with an important message,Filmcapss,10/8/2019,"Joker. Where do I even begin. Never expected a comic book movie to talk about such serious issues that we face today in the world. Mental illness, social economic disparity, social service funding being cut and how mental illness should be treated and what role we play in helping mentally ill people and how they're treated. The best part about Joker is that it never takes a position on these issues, all it does is show us what it's like and holds a mirror up. And that's it. It leaves so many things open ended for the audience to perceive. It's a dark, moody psychodrama which is elevated through Joaquin's performance, Lawrence sher's cinematography and Hildur guðnadóttir's haunting score. Tod Phillips also directed and wrote the film very well. The writing did drop in quality in some scenes during the third act which was one of my only flaws I had, but I'm not getting into spoilers. Watching Joker is a surreal, out of body experience. Some scenes for example the 'bathroom dance' is like being in a hypnotic trance where you don't even wanna blink while watching. And these are just my thoughts on the film, Either way, go watch joker. Support risky films like this that have something to say."
10/10,The Perfect Joker,lmorse-590-175771,10/6/2019,"Joaquin Phoenix's acting is heartbreaking and horrifying; he gives a tremendously physical performance and it is easily up there as one of his best.I found the film astounding: the cinematography is beautiful, the pacing is flawless, the tension builds to breaking point. The whole film comes together brilliantly in a character study that is so believable and gritty that I held my breath the whole way through.I know this review is coming across as gushing, but honestly I cannot imagine how the character could have been portrayed any better. It might be my favourite Batman movie to date, and the Batman is not even in it! I hope this movie is a taste of things to come for the franchise; it makes the Marvel universe look trivial and childish."
10/10,How DC movies should be,hamanoooo23,10/5/2019,"Forget about the critics! They always bash DC for being too 'dark' and, in this case, for promoting violence and mental illness.Enough with the lame joke-infested Marvel type of movies targeted towards kids. The world needs to appreciate the more serious movies that tend to focus on crucial cinematic elements (in particular, plot and character development).This film is no where close to boring as it really shows you the Joker's transition whilst emitting a disturbing vibe that will leave you cringing simply from Joaqin's phenomenal acting."
10/10,Brilliant,nathan_jackson15,10/4/2019,"The movie is very good. A unique story, and Joaquin Phoenix is absolutely superb and definitely on par with Heath ledgers performance in the dark knight (2008). While the movie is slow in parts, you are always on the edge of your seat. Amazing film. Would love to see Joaquin as the Joker again! Nothing but a 10/10"
1/10,Piece of garbage,asadbaidar,10/14/2019,Such a waste of time and money. Boring as hell..!!If it would be possible I would give it -10!!!Overrated....!!!!I guess all because of paid reviews.
8/10,Movie of the year,onjur14,10/9/2019,"This movie shows the true origin of the joker that has never seen before in cinema. I went in expecting non-stop action. But I was wrong, it is more subtle and takes important aspects from the source material. JP's acting is incredible and the trans-formation from Arthur to the Joker is portrayed remarkably well. The laugh he makes added with a great selection of sound and style of the movie makes it that much creepier. You sort of feel sympathy for Arthur and what he's been through even though, he is committing terrible acts of violence. There is elements of dark comedy which blends well with his character. The plot is strong and the director has done a very good job. This stand-alone movie pays great tribute to previous installents and will be go down as one of the best DC movies ever made."
10/10,Best in Venice. Best CBM of all time? Perhaps.,bob_the,8/31/2019,"Joker (2019) is ambitious, tragic, meritorious, a dark comedy, exhilarating, and a masterpiece in cinematic storytelling. Director Todd Phillips, after several questions over his ability to direct a praiseworthy Joker film, delivers a classic movie that will be forever enshrined in the memories of those fortunate enough to experience it. Phillips deconstructs the superhero genre and turns it on its head, forming a film that feels and IS an artful indie film rather than a prototypical A to B superhero movie. Every scene in the film has purpose for Phillips. There is a love for the story being told and a direct care in the manner it is portrayed. And for this Phillips should be praised. He navigates the complexities around the character of the Joker, introducing a fresh take while also attempting to pay homage to movies such as Taxi Driver and King of Comedy. Yet, the movie never falters, not even for a second. It moves through each scene not just feeling new, but breathtaking beautiful that will have you applauding before the credits even roll.Likewise, the details in this film are remarkable, as Phillips not only has one listen to the film, but we actively live in it. We can feel the nasty, garbage-filled streets of Gotham often represented through careful and strategic use of symbolism. But of course, while the movie itself is remarkable, it needs an anchor - the great Joaquin Phoenix.Phoenix delivers the most jaw-dropping performance in a film of the 2000s, and perhaps one of the greatest and most memorable performances of all-time. While the character already complex, Phoenix dives so much into the role that you can hardly recognise him. He is at times funny, delicate, innocent, sometimes he is tragic, heartbreaking, and at times he is the dangerous, horrifying, and unpredictable. Through his complex play on the ranging emotions of one Arthur Fleck, Phoenix becomes the epitome of the Joker.So is this the best comic book movie of all time? For most moviegoers that will be the question. And this film transcends the genre in a manner that has not been done since 2008. Likewise, while the Joker movie is more of a tragedy or even comedy than it is a superhero movie (imagine an indie film with DC characters), with the inclusion of superheros, or supervillains in this case, it will always be a superhero movie.So where does it stand amongst other CBMs? It is top 2, battling with another film that featured the Joker, The Dark Knight."
10/10,One of the best films I have ever seen...,nth-16699,10/12/2019,"I had heard bad reviews from critics on this film but after deciding to go see the film, I do not regret seeing it one bit. The story telling of this film is something the film industry is lacking these days."

10/10,Phoenix Gives His All,brandflakes-98875,10/9/2019,Phoenix Gives His All
10/10,In line with Heith Ledger,luddesweden,10/9/2019,"Ok, nobody can beat Heith Ledger.. But Joaquin Phoenix does the Joker extremely well. I've been waiting for a movie, dark and serious as the Dark knight. I've been longing for a movie that isn't like all the marvel comedies, a movie that feels real.The Joker is effectively shot, the story is perfect and the acting is genius.What I like most is that the Joker is still a mystery, Todd Phillips did not destroy the character. He developed him.The movie is obscure but still so clear, this is one of the best movies made.The fact that people are worried about mass shootings just strengthen the fact that the movie is exceptionally well made. (of course it does NOT promote violence, it just shows how dark violence in fact is, unlike for example Deadpool.)If I wasn't clear enough, see the movie, yesterday."
10/10,Joker is a representation of modern societies troubles,warthogjump,10/9/2019,"The masterpiece behind Joker is multifaceted, which is exactly why it is a masterpiece. It has flawless acting, perfect directing and real, gritty revelations of real life. If anyone thinks this movie is bad because it suggests we should feel empathy towards Arthur despite his evil actions, they are part of the system which caused this trouble in the first place. Mental health does not exist in a vacuum; it is interrelated with a society and a system which does not care for people with disadvantage. Crimes rates soar and the community demands protection and justice; justice is served by detention and alienation. The cycle repeats itself until society is tricked to believing that there is a singular person to blame, but the imperfections of the system and lack of support from society is creating more Jokers than one movie discussing its subject matter. For this reason, Joker is bold, novel and technically perfect, it is a movie for the Ages, akin to that of There Will be Blood and Taxi Driver. It is a character study like no other!"
10/10,The best movie I never want to see again!,jason_macsweeney,10/8/2019,"Let's just get this straight......if Joaquin Phoenix does not win an Oscar for this performance than there is something wrong in the world. As for the movie? Disturbing, thought provoking, fascinating, inciteful and just brilliant. A comic book movie that's not a comic book movie. I never thought Heath Ledger's performance as the joker could be matched but Phoenix's version is simply outstanding."
10/10,Shockingly bad... in a good way. A very good way!,reagansteyn,10/8/2019,"This movie is as dark and morbid as they come. Don't expect this film to have anything to do with Batman or even the joker. They could've just made a film about a random person that struggles with mental health issues and it would've been a winner. Yes, it's a film about how the Joker came to be but for me, it was more than that. There's a much darker yet relatable story that it tells. It's almost a documentary about the very real illness that MANY of us face but are too scared to reveal until breaking point. The addition of the Joker, well, that's just a bonus. It's not often that a film can make you sympathise with the villain especially after some of the gruesome acts he does, yet, somehow by the end, you can't help but be on his side which actually makes you feel a little uncomfortable after the movies over. Brilliant film, incredible acting and certainly plays on your mind for a while after."
10/10,WOW!,ginessekid,10/7/2019,"I always thought of Joker as a evil demonic clown who loves terrorizing people to get his rocks off.And I always wanted to see a really cool back story for him to see what turned him evil but this just blew me away.never ever has a movies protagonist/antagonist made me feel so weird inside how is it it possible someone can be so evil and yet we can sympathize with him ,such a weird feeling I can't stop thinking of it.Brilliant cinematography ,score ,acting ,story ,twists & everything.10/10"
10/10,Do you want to hear a joke?,ksgillihan,10/7/2019,"Growing up I've seen all the iterations of the Joker character. From small screen to big screen. All of them are unique in their own way. Don't compare Phoenix to Ledger as the two Jokers are simply two different interpretations of the same concept. This is the story of the Joker from the inside out. There are no punchlines, no gimmicks and no silver lining. There is no hero in this film. This is a study on the concept of the Joker and how he became who he is. This movie is dark, terrifying, introspective and raw. Phoenix simply disappears in his role and you never wonder where he went. Everyone knows that the Joker is insane but never have we ever seen inside his mind like we do here. From top to bottom this film is a masterpiece in every sense of the word. Phoenix has already won the best actor Oscar. It's just a matter of time before they hand it to him."
10/10,Make Batman good again,serefk,10/7/2019,"Why can't the producers of Batman movies make it as good as this movie? Like it was on Dark Knight. DC should learn from the success of this move. Stop tryin to be like Marvel, have your own style, dark, gloomy and thrilling."
10/10,Joker begins,kane_1371-117-231060,10/6/2019,"This movie is an intense dive into our dysfunctional societies that has taken a turn for the worse.To think the director behind such absurd film like Due Date and Hangover (Not that anything is wrong with those films) would even be willing to make this film in itself is amazing.Joker puts our ugly side under the spotlight and makes you wonder where does a society draw the line.Those that have watched the Swedish film The Square know that this is a concept that many film makers have worked on for so many years.Joker is just the darkest side of this story and question.this line the I am talking about is not the line of justifying the character of Joker but the line that eventually leads to making a person like Joker come to life.This movie constantly paints that picture, where is the line?Where do you put a stop to it?How could you have prevented this from happening?The movie opens with a clearly already broken man prisoner to the society and the system that is not willing or able to help him.Joker's situation is already beyond dire and further down the line you learn about all the happenings that lead to this broken man.The film maker and the actor never paint a heroic picture of Joker, he is not glorified by the movie.He is presented as the byproduct of a society that is eerily familiar.Because whether we like it or not we all are responsible for one another.We all affect each other's lives in ways that we can never imagine and psychological health is to this day a subject that is scoffed at even by the brightest and most free thinking people.No one likes to see where the monster comes from because we do not want to have the blaming finger turned on us.We just want the monster among us shunned, chained and caged and hanged.It is a fact that our failing societal relationships are leading to psychological illnesses and in extreme cases to violent outbursts.Most of these outbursts are introvert and almost nobody pays any attention to them but the extrovert ones are always scoffed at when doctors talk about the need to study and understand them.This is the world that creates Joker which is portrayed and criticized here.Leaving that subject behind lets talk about Joaquin Phoenix.This man is a wonder.I have followed his work through out the years watching him as he evolved with every movie he played and today when you watch Joaquin play Joker you see him through out his career.You see him in Gladiator, you see him in Ladder 49, you see him in Her.He has grown with every movie to the point where he creates this amazingly authentic performance for the audience to take part in.From the very first line, the mimicry, the slightest movement he is the character that he is portraying and he is Joker by the end of the movie.You can hear this pained and sick man, you can see his break point, you can feel his struggles and that makes this performance just exceptional.I am not going to even compare this performance, it really is an entirely different beast and by far one of the best performances I have seen in the recent years and easily the best Joker performance to this day.Lets go into the music...what can be said except intense?Something that I loved was the music choices, they really did convey the world's personality to me as audience.From the jazzy tones of the New York city life (as we know Gotham is basically New York and Chicago mixed into an unholy union) to the musics chosen to deliver the mood of the scene or character it felt really fitting and good.Then we come to the original sound track and we are basically dealing with a drama horror or thriller soundtrack with suspenseful moments and intense moments that makes you sit straight in wait for the impending explosion of events.This is Joker, every camera shot, every movement and every sound is there to make you wait for the right moment that it goes ""BANG"" and puts something new on your lap and this movie has several of those.This is Joker, a movie that studies what elements in a society can lead to the creation of people like Joker and Batman and in my humble opinion this movie delivered on this at every front possible.I wholeheartedly recommend watching this movie to anyone that is a fan of Cinema and good films in general."

10/10,MASTERPIECE,mmsaun,10/6/2019,ANYONE THAT TELLS YOU THAT THIS FILM IS ULTRA-VIOLENT OR PROMOTES GUN VIOLENCE IS LYING TO YOU.Amazing film. MASTERPIECE. A slow simmer to a rapid boiling over the pot great piece of story telling.
10/10,The hype is real.. Best acting material in at least 10 years,stphan-ray,10/5/2019,"Joaquin Phoenix is amazing and in Joker you get to see his real acting material, he's amazing he's great he doesn't hesitate to give it his best and more. Joker movie is the best 2019 movie so far and probably in most recent years, from directing to the writing to the acting to the score, we were mesmerized the whole time, i give it 100 over 10, an American classic that will be talked about for many years."
10/10,10-Nov,cadaudahmad,10/5/2019,One of the finest movies ever made.Best acting performance ever.Best story telling ever.
10/10,Simply... wonderful,mason_wills14,10/5/2019,"This movie has to be one of the best acting performances I have ever seen. Joaquin Phoenix deserves an Oscar, without a doubt. The amount of work that he put into this film paid off. Such a dark and creepy movie. Will definitely be going back to theaters to rewatch. Loved it!"
10/10,The Damn Trailers...,muerdfit,10/4/2019,"Holy hell this turned out to be a good movie. Really enjoyed it in the theaters. One of the few comic movies where you actually start feeling something for the main character. The empathy is born from the good writing and the phenomenal performance of Joaquin Phoenix.The only thing mildly bad stuff about the movie -which isnt an issue about the movie- are the trailers. Dc did it again with the ""lets expose almost every scene in the movie with trailers"" mindset. Dont get me wrong the first teaser with the ""Smile"" piece was really cool and got me hyped for the movie. But it felt like I kinda knew what was gonna happen already. I dont mean the whole scenes itself but where Arthur is gonna in the next scene and stuff.Even if the trailer kinda ruined my first watch I whole heartedly recommend this movie to everyone."
1/10,Just creepy and weird,rhodeosc,10/20/2019,"This is one of the most overrated movies ever. Once again, Joaquin Phoenix's creepy weirdness totally overshadows everything else in this film. He's so desperate to make this his own character, that he makes the whole film awkwardly uncomfortable and unenjoyable to watch. I'm not sure what character he was supposed to be, but it sure wasn't the joker. He was just a creepy guy in a clown costume with extensive psychological issues. Skip this garbage."
10/10,The best in the world,nonabobo,9/1/2019,The best in the world

2/10,Not entertaining at all!,arieb-62933,10/11/2019,"This film was too long, too slow and too dark and unnecessarily violent. It was disturbing and uncomfortable to watch. I will give credit for the music selection.Somebody give Joaquin Phoenix a hug and a Xanax."
10/10,AMAZING!,stephaniexmx-80519,10/9/2019,The best film I've seen in a long time! Absolute amazing!!! Definitely recommend to go & see it! Would definitely go & see it again!
1/10,Hype for no reason,Hyena84,10/14/2019,"I made an imdb account after watching this movie. It was that terrible. Watching Joaquin Phoenix do interperative dance and try really hard to play an effeminate mentally ill person. The change into the Joker never felt earned. The movie itself was predictable and forced. A try hard edgelord masterpiece. Surprised he wasn't wearing a fedora. This movie just doesn't get the joke, because it IS the joke."
10/10,It was Awesome worth the hype,thenaanman,8/31/2019,"The acting,the story,the music, and the cinematography it was all awesome it was perfect looking forward to seeing this movie again with friends and family🤡🤡🤡"
2/10,Over rated piece of 💩💩,leonstokes,11/22/2019,"Good acting but the most boring film I've seen in a long time. I was expecting a slow burner but Jesus Christ, the good scenes in no way over shined the rest of the film and when he finally became the joker he played him like a camp 3 year old, complete pretentious American garbage. Ruined the character for me, hope they never do a sequel."
10/10,Incredible and captivating,pisciotti,10/8/2019,"One of the best movies I've seen in my whole life. This movie has a lot of levels. The psychopath construction is uncomfortable and attractive. It brings an invitation to ask ourselves if the concept of ""good and bad"" makes sense. Because all of us have the potential to become monsters when we're not able to control nor understand our own demons. But only some can exploit their true nature by being precisely a monster. And that keeps me thinking about the bravery and its shadows. It's a movie that hangs onto you and assaults some proper ideas during a burst of laughter. Joaquin Phoenix does an unbelievable job, he's one of my favourite actors and his work impressed me deeply. Incredible art direction, the colours and photography are the perfect apology for Mr Todd Phillips's masterpiece.Incredible and captivating."
10/10,Amazing. Captivating. Immersive. Raw.,akharvey,10/4/2019,"I am typically a fan of what Marvel has done, and initially saw no point to this movie when it was announced and couldn't see Phoenix doing the role justice, particularly after Heath Ledger's brilliant take on the Joker.How wrong was I? This movie starts slowly, and draws you into Arthur's world without you realising it until you can't look away from the screen for fear of missing a single second of it. It is raw, it is personal, it is disturbing, it is sad, and it is deeply resonant of some of the troubles we are experiencing today in the world. This is the Joker, arch-nemesis of Batman, yet you feel empathy for him, and can't completely disagree with his actions. He only hurts those who he perceives hurt him, even if his justice is fatal and doesn't befit the crime. ""Wrong me, and you are dead,"" is not justice, and each of his victims display their own weaknesses and frailties, and aren't inherently bad people.This is a brilliant movie. One of the few I went back to the cinema to watch again. It deserves Oscar recognition for Phoenix, Todd Phillips, cinematography, and the score.Congratulations all round!"
10/10,Cigarettes and Mayhem,alec_ong,10/3/2019,"A very dark movie with superb Acting and Cinematography. I felt all kinds of emotions all throughout the film. Laughter, Pity, Aggression, and finally validation for Arthur fleck towards the end. I can't wait for how they will develop a sequel to this story."
2/10,Dysfunctional,carinalc,10/20/2019,"Aside from Joaquin Phoenix's performance being brilliant, I didn't enjoy the movie at all. The movie was slow & stayed on the same platitude."

4/10,Nice acting but bad story,mohkhair379,10/6/2019,The acting is good but they waste the movie time with repeating the same subject there is a missing part in movie to give attention to the storylineJust watched him laughing only and the repeated it many times for nothingActually i did not complete the last 10 minutes as it was boring and each time tried to leave i was saying just give it another 10 minutes maybe something will happen but really nothing
1/10,Self indulgent,dwbell,11/22/2019,No surprises here. This was just the same idea played over over and over. How about that Joker Ballet in the toilet?! Hilariously bad.

10/10,Best Acting Performance of the decade !,siddhant-13114,10/15/2019,"I'm mesmerised , overwhelmed by the sheer beauty of Joaquin's Acting. The best cinematic experience I hve had in a long time. So glad I watched this in theatre."
10/10,Whoever doesn't give 10 stars is a JOKE,culebra-285,10/13/2019,"As I see the rating go from 9/10 to 8.9/10 I wonder who are the kind of people that would put this movie to such shame. Ultimately this movie needs a review of at THE LEAST 9/10 here. #YangGang #HumanityFirst, but 9/10 people.. Come on, amazing movie!!"
10/10,Sad,ronaldmwendwa,10/10/2019,This movie mad me unbearably sad but I loved every moment of it a beautiful beautiful joker movie
10/10,10-Oct,robin_rooijakkers,10/8/2019,Perfect movie with a great storyline.The actor was amazingly skilled and the camerawork was very well done in the scenes where it mattered the most. Best movie 2019.
10/10,The best film of the year and possibly the best of the 21st century,rafagg-16243,10/8/2019,"What to say about this film that does not reflect the title, is the best we have been able to enjoy lately, everything is wonderful, the exquisite photography, the right atmosphere, the amazing and unsurpassed script, all seasoned in addition with a sublime direction of Todd Phillips, which shows that we must follow him very closely in future projects.And I leave a point exclusively for Joaquin Phoenix, the guaranteed winner of the next Oscar, in my opinion it is one of the best male performances in the history of the seventh art, I do not think there are concrete words to do justice to his interpretation, therefore I will not say anything else.Everyone should watch this movie. 10/10"
10/10,Way better than I expected,zuzumalkawidrake,10/8/2019,"I loved the movie, great actor great actingIt was soooooo goodSad and depressiveBut cool"
10/10,why hate it?,younusfarooqi,10/7/2019,This movie defines the reality of pur society we r living inNow a days people just enjoy movies like avengers based on action and fight but dont like movies which based on their lives and the society they r living in
10/10,This movie was worth writing my first ever review about!!,austinmosher-11600,10/7/2019,"I was have been anticipating this one for awhile and watched every trailer and clip and couldn't wait then read the critics reviews and was a little disappointed but still excited to see it and thank God i did! I don't know how critics have jobs cuz this movie was absolutely INCREDIBLE! OUTSTANDING performance by Phoenix, intense storyline, and the soundtrack was the cherry on top! Best movie i have seen in years!!!"
10/10,Unreal Performance...,StephenIsADumb,10/7/2019,If Joaquin Phoenix doesn't get an Oscar for this it will only be because Hollywood is too sensitive. Probably best portrayal of the Joker yet...even though I still love Heath Ledger's version. This is just on another level! Would only warn against seeing this if you can't handle disturbing images/violence/dialogue. I have seen some of the worst cinema has to offer and I still got nervous sweats and felt incredibly uncomfortable the whole way through. Good luck!
10/10,A MUST SEE MOVIE,yashitha-48433,10/6/2019,"I went in for the second time for this movie because of how blown away I was the first time and how bone-chilling the experience was, the second time was no different it only made me appreciate the movie even more. An absolute must see, one of the greatest movies ever made in the 21st century with one of the greatest acting performances of all time by Joaquin Phoenix since heath ledger in the dark knight! Truly the best acting in the history of cinema! (10/10)"
10/10,Heath ledger would be proud,aaron_arasasingham,10/6/2019,"Joaquin Phoenix literally changed the game with acting as the joker. Left the cinema in amazement. I was virtually nearly off my seat for majority of the movie, and the movie definitely relates to what is going on in the world right now."
10/10,Oscar,ddon-58074,10/6/2019,If this movie is not recognised by the Oscars then the hope in great performances will be lost.
10/10,Joker is not a movie. Its a phenomenon and a rare phenomenon.,ranashahzaib16,10/5/2019,"Went to watch the movie as a Heath ledger fan, came out as Joaquin Phoenix biggest fan. Best perfomance I've seen for any character. The movie is a bit slow at times but thats how character building is done. The movie absorbs you in itself with each upcoming scene.Highly Recommended."
10/10,"Stunning, disturbing and one hell of a good film!",putkarazbivach,10/5/2019,"Stunning, disturbing and one hell of a good film!"
10/10,Legit,tonyleconceptartist,10/4/2019,The only thing that bugged me is Joker's make up lol
9/10,Just Give Pheonix The Oscar Now,slightlymad22,10/4/2019,"I just got out of watching JokerI have to say, it is really good... Possibly even great!! As a stand alone origin story, it's damn good. It moves at the pace of a 70's movie, so it may not be for everyone, but I found it mesmerizing to a level that it makes it an absolute winner. I think if they chopped about 15 minutes off the run time, it would have been better, whilst not missing a beat. There are elements of The King of Comedy and Taxi Driver as well as American Psycho.Now... Joaquin Phoenix might as well clear a space on his mantelpiece for an Oscar. I would be shocked if there is a better performance this year. The man is in every single scene. He carries this and at times, you forget that he is acting. His laugh is so real and twisted... The way he lost weight and transformed his body... The pain his character suffers and all the discoveries he makes that shape his life are just amazing and gracefully danced into a spectacular performance.There were a few predictable moments, but nothing to spoil the enjoyment!!Overall, this is a film to see, just to see one of the greatest actors of our time at the very top of his game.My screening was packed!! Only a spare seat here and there (annoyingly an ex and her new fella were in attendance🙈) second only to Avengers: End Game was was a complete sell out."
2/10,Highly Overrated,bossfan-44258,10/20/2019,Boring film. Kept waiting for it to get going. Joaquin Phoenix (who is normally one of my favorite actors) was irritating and monotonous. I honestly could not wait for this film to end.
9/10,Deeply Unsettling,evanston_dad,10/11/2019,"It's been a long time since I've been as unsettled by a movie as I was by ""Joker."" The last one I can think of that comes close was ""First Reformed"" from last year, another film that taps into some very dark and disturbing feelings about the state of our modern world. But that movie at least offered the possibility of hope if you were willing to interpret it a certain way, whereas ""Joker"" is about as damn near nihilistic as you can get.I didn't really even want to see this movie, because I'm sick to death of the whole superhero craze and our country's obsession with it. The Joker is one of the most overexposed of all villains, and I didn't give a rat's ass about his origin story. But the thing is, this is barely a movie about the Batman Joker. It's pretty clear that director Todd Phillips and actor Joaquin Phoenix can barely muster up the energy to tie this story into any greater mythology, and the few meager attempts to do so are the only times during the movie when my brain hit snooze and my attention drifted. The rest of the film is a deeply disturbing character study of a lone man who's so tired of trying to play by the rules of a system that has no place for him that he decides to make his own. I won't call Phoenix a revelation, because we all knew he could act, but holy cow does he do something special in this movie. This is Daniel Day-Lewis in ""There Will Be Blood"" territory we're talking about here, where the word ""acting"" seems inadequate to describe what's happening on screen.There's a lot of controversy swirling around ""Joker."" Is it irresponsible to make a movie that basically gives lonely, angry white men a justification to carry out violent acts? Is the film just an empty, soulless, and cynical attempt to cash in on people's love of Batman and the series' villains? Is the film just ripping off of other, better movies, like ""Taxi Driver"" and ""King of Comedy?"" I think people will see what they want to see in ""Joker."" Some will see a hero figure in Arthur Fleck, and will either love or hate the movie because of it. Some will think the film is deep and profound while others will think it has nothing to say. I personally don't know that the film has anything to say, but the history of movies is full of great films that haven't necessarily ""said"" anything. ""Joker"" is a reaction to our very troubled times, and I was able to empathize with the character of Arthur Fleck to a certain point without condoning all of his actions. He's a mentally ill man who wants to get help but doesn't know how, or who's the victim of a system that doesn't care about mentally ill people. Meanwhile, the system is run by a bunch of fat cats who only care about making themselves and their cronies richer, while life for the average American gets harder and harder. Toss in our country's obsession with violence in general and guns in particular, and people like Arthur Fleck will be the inevitable result. I didn't interpret the movie as a rallying cry for incels, and I don't think it glamorized violence at all. Leave it to the ""Mission: Impossible"" movies (just as one example) to do that, yet no one ever holds movies like that to task. But I do think that more people than not may find someone to relate to in Arthur Fleck, and maybe that's what's so unsettling. Like him, and like Howard Beale, another famous movie character who's fed up with the system, I'm mad as hell, and I don't want to take it anymore. Of course I will, because I'm a rational adult who understands that progressive change moves forward in fits and starts. But wouldn't it feel just a little bit good to say screw it all and burn down the whole mess?It will be interesting to see how my reactions to ""Joker"" change over time and after we've passed this specific cultural moment. Who knows, maybe I'll think it's silly and juvenile twenty years from now when I think back on the Best Actor Oscar Joaquin Phoenix is almost certain to win. But right now, there's not a movie I've seen recently that feels more relevant or urgent than this one, and the balls this film has makes everything else currently playing look like a made-for-T.V. movie by comparison.Grade: A"
10/10,Truly outstanding!,korn_andreas,10/4/2019,A more human and logical approach of the origins of joker! Definitely will touch your souls and remember every scene for a long time! A must see

2/10,Save your money and time.,rahulthomas-07708,10/14/2019,Phoenix tries to put a great effort. This movie is truly devoid of any plot or interaction. Not much happens and the pace is terrible. The overall theme of galvanizing those who society has overlooked was much better done in Fight Club.
10/10,A work of art,ibraahm,10/9/2019,One of the best performances I've ever seen Joaqin phoenix truly deserves an oscar for this.... besides the great acting and magnificent castEvery thing else is very well done ( the directing the camera movement .... )They've done there best to transfer the tragedy of the joker and make us sympathise him .
10/10,"Ignore the critics, this is the movie of the decade!",ayoung33,10/9/2019,"I can see many scenes of this movie becoming iconic.The scene on the stairs and the fabulous but creepy dance Joker makes as a way to release anxiety. I can see it become famous just like the Rocky Balboa jump or the ""I am the King of the World"" standing with the open arms from Titanic.I haven't seen a movie this good in ages; It is funny, it is creepy, its has suspense, it has violence, action. It is intense. It shows mental illness in a way very few movies have done it in the past.It has smart jokes and if you ever felt depressed or lonely in your life (which most people have), you will understand it much better.The movie has 2 hours but it feels like 20 minutes providing such intensity and hanging on the edge of the seat story lineJoaquin deserves an Oscar, so does the movie not only because its great but to encourage director and movies companies to invest in more movies like this.Don't listen to the ""critics"" about this movie, the people are loving it and the voice of the people is the voice of God. Critics they go in the opposite direction of the flow because they see themselves as being ""different"" and they want to be different by saying something else than what everybody says in a bid to make them look like they ""know"" more than everyone else. If everybody loves a movie, they will hate it. And if everybody hates a movie, they will love it. Its always the same thing.Everyone can be a critic nowadays, thanks to the internet. So don't listen to them anymore, its just an outdated way of reviewing movies and not one bit reliable anymore.Go watch Joker and jump to your own conclusions, I bet you won't regret watching it."
1/10,"Unwatchable, uncomfortable, predictable trainwreck of a film.",skapunk85,10/13/2019,"I literally created an imdb account for the first time in order to attempt to warn people off of this terrible film. I have nothing good to say about it at all. It was a poorly crated story awkwardly told. The only saving grace is that Joaquin Phoenix acted an awful character in an awful story. I couldn't wait for the movie to end. I found it to be incredibly obvious and predictable for every ""twist"" in the film. The end credits were the best part when I finally was free. I was on a date or I would have just walked out early on."

10/10,Believe the hype!,tsakrilisteo,10/11/2019,"Do not let the matacritic score fool you ! It is comprised of people who are quick to label the film edgy jusy because it touches on social matters, people who in my opinion should not be able to publish a movie rating as professionals. Everything that has to do with The Joker is done in a perfect way. Not only is phoenix's performance astonishing but the cinematography and climate of the film are perfect. It is truly a drama that makes an excellent background story for the character and has you on your heels everytime Joaquin is on the screen. Plus the violence felt very impactful and carried a message instead of simply being a way to make the film more intense."

I would be the Villain If I would do.Thank you Todd Phillips."
10/10,Believe the hype,artisse4,10/11/2019,I almost didn't go to see this as I've always had a problem viewing movies that have so hyped. But to be honest this is one movie worth seeing. I have been a total fan of Heath Ledgers Joker since it came out but to be fair this is worthy of being right up there with it. Phoenix's Joker is mesmerising and I found it hard to look away no matter how difficult the situation. I felt a lot of things during this performance and didn't need the whole box and dice of CGI trickery to get me there! Just stunning performances by all concerned. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone
10/10,Absolutely amazing,robhemp-65207,10/10/2019,Joaquin Phoenix's performance in joker is amazing everything about this movie is amazing. Amazing script great acting 10/10 you need to see this movie
7/10,Darkest and grittiest film of the year,Heisenberg999,10/10/2019,"From the director of ""The Hangover"" trilogy comes a dark and gritty version of Joker's origin story. His version of the Joker seems to be heavily inspired by Martin Scorsese's ""The King of Comedy"" with a touch of ""Taxi Driver"". On top of that, there are some attempts of commentary about society and how crooked it is. When you mix all those things up, you get a film that's going to divide everyone's opinions.Let's begin with the good stuff first. Easily, the best part of the film was a performance by Joaquin Phoenix. He carried this film completely and he gave one of the better performances of his career (nothing is going to beat his performance in ""The Master""). He proved once again why he's one of the best actors working today. If someone else was in his place, there's no way this film would've worked. His mannerisms, facial expressions (especially how he showed so many different emotions through laughs and eye expressions at the same time), his physicality and his vulnerability were incredible. If this film received a bit better reviews he would definitely be the main contender for that Oscar. Furthermore, the next aspect with which I was blown away was the score. I would even say that the score was a more effective way of showing emotions than the script. Because of the score at every moment, you knew how you were supposed to feel regarding what's happening on the screen, and that was achieved in a way that wasn't forceful. If you listen carefully to the score, you can even distinguish what scenes happened in reality and which were just in his imagination. Those two aspects of the film were outstanding and they carried the film noticeably. The color palette really nicely supported the script. Through the colors in the film, you could've seen in what mood the main character was and how he felt about what was happening around him. Colors helped to immerse the audience into that time period (I would say the film happened in 1981 because the movie theatre was showing the film ""Blow Out"" which came out in that year), but that wouldn't work without production design which was on the point.The cinematography was decent. Although the director's vision wasn't groundbreaking I generally enjoyed most of the camera choices.Let's get into some aspects that weren't so good. The script. It's one of the weakest parts of the film. You get a feeling the film wanted to say a lot, but unfortunately, it ended up saying almost nothing. There were a lot of attempts to give some social commentary, but for me personally, that fell flat because there wasn't any explanation of why is everything how it is. Joker as a character for the huge part of the film was complaining about how society is bad and how everyone is mean, but there wasn't any reason given why is the world like that, beyond poverty and poor people suck and rich people are corrupted and evil. Regarding that specific aspect, I felt like the director wanted to say a lot, but it just ended up being shallow and on the nose. The film was beating you over the head of how everything is bad. I would've appreciated concluding by myself that the world is crooked, but instead, I was just told what the situation was, without any room for my own interpretations. And that explained situation wasn't backed up with any other pieces of information. This time, tell don't show approach didn't work out. Furthermore, speaking of the script, all characters except Joker were unbelievable and underwritten. Zazie Beetz was completely unutilized and the relationship between her character and the Joker was underdeveloped. The film was supposed to make you believe in their relationship, but it didn't and because of it the film suffered at the later stages of its runtime. I understood what did film tried to achieve with their relationship, but that wasn't realized very well. That sentence could've been used for many aspects of this film. Robert De Niro as an older version of Rupert Pupkin had a ton of fun in this film, one of the better De Niro's performances since ""Casino"". They could've done more with his character, but at least it seemed like he had fun with this project. So, Joker is basically the only character that was decently written, but the thing is, the director didn't make a clear choice if we were supposed to feel for him or we were supposed to hate him because of his actions. Don't get me wrong, he isn't a good person, but the film way too many times tried to make the audience sympathize with him. I don't know if that was intentional or not, but at the times it felt way too forceful.In the end, looking at the whole picture, this is a good film but isn't anything spectacular. At the same time, I would say the film was overblown with praises of how good it was, and yet at the same time, it was unfairly criticized because of some aspects in the film (e.g. the usage of violence)."
4/10,Disappointed,johannamt01,10/9/2019,"I must say I'm disappointed. I love the Batman universe and especially the story behind Joker. Considering it's been a lot of talk around this movie, I expected more. The first half of the movie was pretty long drawn, towards the end it was great but not so much before that in my opinion. They could have done so much more with the time they had.Also, something that I struggle with is that every move Joker made was very predictable basic psychology (my opinion). Joker isn't supposed to be predictable, that is a part that makes him so interesting. Besides from all that the actor did an amazing job potraying Joker!"
10/10,Oscars awaits !,bk-dela,10/9/2019,Heath ledger would be so proud!It was amazing! Blew my mind ! I will watch it again and again !After a long time finally a good movie ! Enjoyed every second with every cell of my body !
10/10,"Outstanding Performance, Unmatchable Storyline, Impresive Thriller.",drpablocalamari,10/9/2019,"A long time i did not enjoy and get marveled by a film.If the decition depend on me, I said, Oscar to Best Film, And Oscar to Best Leading Role to Joaquin Phoenix, there is no equal, One of the most difficult role to perform in movies history and its overwhelm by Joaquin. You must see this film an prepear to see masterful performance in every detail."
10/10,Movie that has all the chances to become classics,Vitalik_Denys,10/8/2019,"Every year I deal with one issue - less new movies that deserve to be called art. But Joker is a rare example of what you can call art in every way. The creators of this movie made 2019 successful by making Joker, making the viewer feel wide range of emotions that push us beyond borders of standard perception. Thank you for this piece of art, a gift for all of us who create new perceptions and new visions."
10/10,Ultimate tale of morality,Jaynee_Cee,10/8/2019,"It's been reported that some people found the level of violence so graphic they have walked out of the showing..I can understand why. It's inexcusable that they did as they missed the ultimate tale in morality and their lives will be poorer for that fact.If you expect to see a bells and whistle CGI extravagance, you'll be disappointed. If, like me, you want a psychonautical joyride into the creation of the character of Joker.. open yourself to the lesson you're about to receive.Joaquin's portrayal is by far the superior version and most credible I have watched to date and his is a performance, I feel, cannot be surpassed, and should not, as here is the ultimate lesson of the nature of humanity - a poignant tale of human kindness and the consequences when that chain fails.. there are always repercussions for that imbalance and in the Joker, we see the deepest, darkest, most tragic and twisted sequence of consequences that should be a wake up call for us all, particularly now with the social injustices that are now common place. A Joker is reflected in each dispossessed person and we are many.A genuine masterclass in acting by Phoenix. The collaboration between Todd Phillips and Scott Silver is sheer brilliance."
9/10,"Beautiful, Mesmerizing and Haunting",watching_movies_since_birth,10/7/2019,"I miss Heath Ledger and can't get enough of his portrayal of Joker. He was intimidating, scary, unpredictable and all other things. In 2016, we got Suicide Squad and Jared Leto as Joker both of which disappointed me very much. After that, I thought that I don't want to see another Joker interpretation on the big screen. I was skeptical when I heard that a standalone Joker movie was in works. Then I heard about the casting of Joaquin Phoenix as Joker and I developed an interest in it because I love his work. He is a method actor and has given some of my favorite performances for example in Her (2013) and The Master (2012). I decided to see the movie in the theater after hearing a lot about the movie, good and bad and I am glad that I saw it.This movie is really good, it exceeded my expectations and Joaquin Phoenix should get an Oscar for his work. He is phenomenal and I was blown away by his performance. His performance alone carries the whole movie and lets you experience and understand the character without saying much. His physique, movements, gestures, grace, way of speaking suggests that he gave his everything to make the character compelling and stand out from other Joker portrayals. He lost 52 pounds for the role. He embodied the character of Joker. Comparing his performance with Heath Ledger will be absurd. There is no common ground for comparison. Both interpretations of Joker are significantly different, the story is different, character motivations are different.Now talking about the story, this is a standalone Joker movie that shows how a man beaten up, neglected and humiliated by the society turns into a maniac. This movie follows Arthur Fleck who works as a party clown and lives with his mother. He wants to be a stand-up comic. He suffers from a condition causing him to laugh uncontrollably. We feel his loneliness, depression, and condition and sympathize with him for it. All the other performances were also very good. This movie isn't that much violent as people are saying it to be, but it makes you feel the violence and it is unsettling. It also allows the viewer to form their perspective about the character. Sometimes you will agree with his actions and sometimes you won't. There are also certain funny scenes in the movie but not everyone may find it funny.The movie is directed by Todd Phillips and he has done an outstanding job. I didn't think that the guy who made The Hangover movies can pull this off, but he did it. He showed that as a filmmaker, he can make more than just R rated comedies. The film is set in 1981 and the period is very well reflected in the movie. The cinematography is top-notch. Shot composition, camera placement, camera movement has been handled well. I was surprised by how good the Gotham city looked, beautiful and dirty at the same time. Each scene had a color scheme. The lights in the surroundings like light from streetlights, cars or the sky illuminated everything with their light. Joker/Arthur Fleck's emotions get conveyed through shades of light falling on him which is beautiful to look at. Music is beautiful, chilling, hypnotizing and speak lengths about the inner feelings of the character.I have just a few issues with the plot of the movie and how some things happen which shouldn't have happened or couldn't have happened, rest the movie is flawless."
10/10,There are movies.. And there are masterpieces. This is one of them!,chiyaan,10/2/2019,"I really liked the way heath ledger portrayed joker in dark knight. Funny, cunning, evil. If he was living today, he would have aced this movie. But surprisingly, Joaquin does it even better. He is rarely funny but very alone and pathetic. His condition becomes worse and worse until he breaks out, wreaking havoc to Gotham. The story flows smoothly through Arthur's life, how the situation around influences him to become the joker. The supporting characters including Robert de Niro have done an excellent job but nobody can beat Joaquin. He was at a completely different level!! A pure masterclass of cinema. If you are a fan of joker, don't miss this one! Another Oscar worthy performance from Joaquin. If he gets it, it ll be second time for the same role."
10/10,How can someone dislike this movie!?,abdulmalekismailrostam,10/3/2019,You never seen anything like this Joaquin shines so bright that you would be amazed of how great he is in this movie everything about this movie is perfect i promise.
10/10,Must watch,cantrol_alnuim,10/9/2019,Must watch
9/10,Wow. Just... wow.,Pjtaylor-96-138044,10/6/2019,"'Joker (2019)' is one of the most intense and disturbing films I've seen in a long time. It really is surprisingly fantastic, an unsettling and complex character-study that's as uncompromising as it is gripping. Inspiration was clearly taken from 'The King Of Comedy (1982)' and, to a lesser degree, 'Taxi Driver (1976)', but this isn't just a cut-and-paste copy. It's very much its own beast, as much a horror movie as it is a comic-book one. Don't let Phillips fool you, by the way, this certainly is a comic-book movie. It's a phenomenal comic-book movie that blows almost all others out of the water, but a comic-book movie nonetheless. It takes inspiration from several well-known storylines and has a firm grasp on both its titular character and all the other classic Gotham elements, much more so than one might expect given the marketing. None of this is meant as a slight, just an exploration of the fact that comic-book movies are ""real"" movies. Here, we have a probable career-best performance from Phoenix, who's often frightening even when sitting still, and a definite career-best directorial effort from Phillips, who seems to have elevated himself far beyond the generally well-regarded 'The Hangover (2009)'. The whole thing is just so well-made, clearly crafted with absolute clarity of vision from the very beginning. The screenplay is great, the cinematography is gorgeous and the musical score is outright masterful. The flick works so well because it doesn't pretend there are 'heroes and villains'. You don't really identify with the protagonist, you pity him. You want him to be okay, to find a way out of his inevitably dark situation, but certainly aren't cheering along with him when things eventually get even worse. There's no 'good guy', just a guy. He undergoes some serious trauma and, often, the piece elicits a strong emotional response when this happens. Yet, when he decides to deal with it in a criminal way, you're never 'on his side'. Instead, you just watch in shock and horror, glued to the edge of your seat. Indeed, the violence here is some of the most impactful I've seen, each moment punching you straight in the gut. It's not fun, it's horrible and that's how it should be. There's no doubt that this is an amazing feature. It's absolutely gripping and I can't stress that enough. It gets under your skin and wriggles around, as interesting to reflect on as it is to watch. It's not exactly 'nice' but it's not supposed to be. It's brave, realistic stuff that's easily up there, right at the top, as one of the best of the year. As a footnote, I just can't believe how well they incorporated the Joker's classic laugh into a piece as grounded as this; it's chilling, tragic and integral to the character, yet still as over-the-top as you'd think (though, you might not realise it when it happens). Honestly, I still can't quite comprehend how good this whole affair is. It's simply divine. 9/10"
10/10,BRILLIANT!!!! BRILLIANT!!!! BRILLIANT!!!!,tamaramarkovich,10/3/2019,"We watched Joker tonight, and I expected good acting from Joaquin Phoenix, wasn't sure about the story and everything else but I was willing to see how it will go. What I didn't expect was that I wouldn't blink an eye throughout the movie. It was absolutely brilliant. Joaquin Phoenix didn't just give us good performance, but made Joker so real. Like he is one of us, and as my friend said - scary part was that you could relate to him and be on the same track with his thoughts. Everything is perfect in this movie - story, acting, photography, music... hell even the colors of this world are perfect. Joaquin Phoenix carried the whole storry on his back - it was an one man show that took all your attention, imagination, stirred all your feelings and emotions and left you speechless when The End letters came on the screen. The best movie this year for sure - Phoenix deserves Oscar for this one and any other reward he can get in this world. BRILLIANT!!!!"

4/10,Joker is what happens when one reads Taxi Driver wrong.,satyamsai,10/3/2019,"Travis Bickle is also an anti-hero like Arthur Fleck, so many bad things at once, a product of the times, but his actions are never justified or rendered aspirational either through plot or aesthetics of the film. The same goes for Rupert Pupkin in Scorsese's another masterpiece 'The King of Comedy' from which Todd Philips, the director, heavily borrows but without any proper insight or thought. Class divide, neurological issues, childhood trauma and all that glitter is thrown in the movie to disguise the shallow depth of ideas and adds to the confusion. The film tries to be so many things and ends up being none. 'Poser' would be a better title.Joaquin Phoenix's acting is everything though. Very familiar but still feels fresh and knocks your socks off (and oh that laugh is haunting) and he was the singular reason I didn't walk out of the film after the first 15 minutes because the moment Arthur Fleck commits the third murder (and which obviously was not a self-defense tactic), I thought, ""lo beta, ghus gaye na ghhade me! Yahan se impossible hai nikalna."" And making my worst fears come true, this humorless film just kept on digging that first act grave.So, in short: Loved Joker. Just hated the film he was in.PS: Watch HBO's 'Succession' if you want to take notes on how to have a people as your protagonists, humanize them and still maintain that much-necessary ironic distance from them."

1/10,What the hell,Movielover44553,10/13/2019,"I HATE THIS MOVIE!!!! It is complete crap. I really don't understand the hype over it. I was watching it and just couldn't watch it till the end.. it was so boring. I made myself go and watch it again till the end, but again there was no way for me to do that. It was extremely boring, made no sense, zero connection to Joker. When I saw people writing that Joaquin is better joker than Heath Ledger I just needed to see that. But now I'm asking myself are these people freaking normal, you just can't put these two names in the same sentence. Joaquin's joker can't and never will be better because it even isn't a joker, it is a disaster."

Suffice to say this is a slow burn movie with brilliant director, leading cast and cinematography and run down Gotham City staging that makes this a mesmerising movie experience. Everyone will be talking about their favourite moments - mine includes a certain door key!Joaquin as the evil Emperor Commodus gave us the famous 'thumbs down' to Russell Crowe as Maximus in Gladiator but it is a resounding 'thumbs up' for his remarkable portrayal of mentally ill Arthur Fleck in his descent to madness to become the criminal mastermind known as the Joker.."

Phoenix's acting is ""off the hook"" amazing. Rarely have I ever left the movie theater mesmerized by what I just saw. I am just simply glad that I saw a masterpiece like that in my lifetime...and it proved to me that the film industry, one that has been sadly fixated on CGI and special effects, is still capable of making a film that can penetrate the soul of the audience with a great script and amazing acting."

10/10,Put on a happy face!!,chandraguptamaurya,10/14/2019,"To appreciate ""Joker"" I believe you have to have either gone through something traumatic in your lifetime (and I believe most of us have) or understand somewhere in your psyche what true compassion is (which usually comes from having gone through something traumatic, unfortunately). An example of dangerous compassion would be to, say, make a film made about the fragility of the human psyche, and make it so raw, so brutal, so balletic that by the time you leave the theatre you not only don't want to hurt anything but you desperately want an answer and a solution to the violence and mental health issues that have spun out of control around us.-Josh Brolin"
10/10,OSCAR WINNER!!!,tsreece,10/12/2019,"If this film doesn't win several Oscar's, I will eat my hat! Mr Phoenix is sublime.

I admit that it's not as good as Heath Ledger's Joker, but it's still awesome. The funny thing is that there's a good reason why the movie isn't called ""THE Joker"". The creators said that the Joker might just be a persona various people took. Batman does in fact appear in this, but only as a small child. He's worked very well into the plot.I could really associate with what Joker was going through. He had been taking all these medicines yet none of them worked. He was angry at the rich for oppressing the poor. Him killing rich people at first really does inspire people. It really was a great study on the status of the richest and treats the story as very mundane. That was kind of already done in ""The Dark Knight"", but the focus is done so well here too. ***1/2"

10/10,The best Joker in history,dankezza57,10/8/2019,What can I say? I'm a massive Batman fan and a little obsessed with the franchise. I wanted to watch this movie to get a background on the Joker to complete my Batman experience. I've watched every Batman ever made including the Adam West TV show as a kid.I came out of this movie in absolute awe and to be honest a little emotional. It was a beautiful portrayal of a beautifully mad man. I feel emotional after watching it. It spoke to me on so many levels. What would happen if we just let go and have in to the voices in our heads and ignored societies restraints? This was what happens.Hands down the best movie I've ever seen in my life. Without a doubt. Heath Ledger looks like Bonzo the clown compared to this. As for Old mate from suicide squad he needs to never do another one.

10/10,"Not a Joker film, however...",psycadelix,10/6/2019,"I guess the people not happy with this film expected a typical ""Joker"" movie. It's not. It's a film about the man who 'becomes' the Joker. A character study. This is not a feel good movie and don't expect to leave the cinema feeling happy. It's depressing, it's bleak and it's quite uncomfortable to watch at points. It has a constant fog of dread hanging over it that's heavy.You feel sorry for this person, probably even root for him and that's a real weird thing as we know what he eventually becomes, but I suspect that was the point.The music score is outstanding, adding massively to the film in no other way I can think of than how the track from Jaws impacted that film so much.The filmography is also top not notch.Phoenix is absolutely electric, you cannot take your eyes off him. If he doesn't win an Oscar for this performance, he might as well pack up and forget about it. He could do no more.Best film I've seen in a long time, which is a weird thing as, again, you don't leave with a feel good vibe, but it's all the better for it.Outstanding."
10/10,A perfect tribute to the Joker!,fibfranc,10/2/2019,"The character of Joker received much more love even though being an antagonist in The Dark Knight Trilogy. Todd Philips did a phenomenal job of creating an origin story for Joker and had the guts to present a standalone movie to the public. This movie leaves you in a shock for a moment and makes you think a lot. Some shocking moments that totally grips you, I find no reason as to keep this movie reserved for only 18+Camera movement and the shots taken are so cool that they deliver a story without a single dialogue being said. This movie keeps you glued to the screen till the end credits roll in.It is a must watch for all Joker Fans and I believe the count of these fans will increase all the more!"
10/10,Do i need to say more OUTSTANDING,hemanthp93,10/2/2019,Phoenix showed me what it is to be a joker. i watched the whole movie with heath in mind.one scene actually showed me heath . the transformation is brilliant. mother sentiment is beautiful.Gripped me from the beginning.Arthur fleck /Joker is definitely will be in mind for a long time.much awesome direction from todd phillips. Stunner
1/10,A Banal and Pointless Exercise,ssurgeon-18216,10/15/2019,"If Todd Phillips wanted to spend $55 million on creating yet another pointlessly glorified, anti-hero and attempt to pass it off as a case study of a mentally ill agent being displaced by society, he could've at least spent a portion of that budget employing people who are able to contribute honest, fair, and much-needed portrayals of actual disaffected minorities in society."

I extremely dislike the ways to send the genuine message about mental illness: unrealistically ugly graffiti everywhere on/in the bus and buildings, unreasonable intensified music here and there, over-centered crime scenes, unrealistic incapable/stupid police, weird development of psychiatric disorders, unbelievable reaction of the society to the crime behaviors... all of them make me extremely uncomfortable rather than enjoying the show."
2/10,Just a random.movie,anas-raissihaouari,10/13/2019,The joker went with Heith ledgerI didnt found anything special except the music and the direction...the cast of joakin is brilliant but the story is poor and details are missedNothing that brilliant except the 6 months of commercial advertising
9/10,The best acting I've seen in a while,jackdupuy,12/8/2019,Joaquin Phoenix's performance illustrates what mind-blowing acting should be like. Director Todd Philips mostly known for his comedies has just shown us that he can really do anything as the cinematography and music in Joker was just phenomenal. This is why I give the film a 10/10.
9/10,Perfect!,p-baruh,12/2/2019,"I feel that no amount of words would suffice to describe such an amazing movie! The cinematography,acting,sound design and how it's directed is incredible. I would say that this movie deserves an Oscar."
10/10,"Dark, gritty and visceral! A must see!",kosy-62100,11/30/2019,"This movie is a masterpiece! The acting and character development is one of a kind. Not your typical kid friendly action hero movie (I was hoping it wouldn't be). Instead, it tells the story of a deeply disturbed man and his rise to power. A psychological work of art.A must see!"
10/10,Best movie of 2019,fardad_011,11/29/2019,"Masterpiece movie of the decade to influence generations.Joker is a Traumatizing psychological drama/thriller that puts the spotlight on a comic book villian called joker.Though the movie is inspired by the comic world which is imaginary, the movie feels real and authentic.Unlike other comic book movies which are filled with CGI and animation, joker uses story over action.The movie is about arthur fleck (joaquin phoenix), a middle aged, miserable, poor standup comedian who suffers from mental problems and lives with his old mother.He lives in gotham city where the people are cruel, emotionless and awful. Arthur is lonely and helpless yet he tries to be a good human being by sending positive energy and trying to make the people laugh and smile but the others are so wicked, merciless, enraged and furious they don't even accept him and make him feel worse by bullying, beating and abandoning him. Imagine what happens when a victim of society runs out of patience and turns extremely evil.The atposphere of the film is quite dark and the pace of the movie is a little slow in the beginning but as we go forward in the story it goes faster and faster just like a roller coaster.The music and soundtracks used in the movie are perfectly in place and completely related to the theme of movie.The climacteric of the movie is joaquin phoenix's fabulous and oscar worthy acting , where he delivers the sense of the film in the best way possible.Joker might be one of the darkest movies made in decades but definitely deserves to be watched with patience and attention because it's one of the few movies that besides giving audience entertainment it tries to make people think."

10/10,A true masterpiece!,marcus-j-810-371530,11/20/2019,This is the kind of movie you only see once per decade or so and realize that you are watching a future classic/masterpiece of art.J.Phoenix is hypnotizing to watch and deserves two Oscar statuettes if that was possible for his performance as Arthur/Joker.Also Todd Phillips deserves an Oscar for both the directing and the writing of this movie.A true masterpiece and a must watch. Speechless for any other word to describe this movie. 10/10!
10/10,Fabulous,philippe-art,11/19/2019,"I was blown away by the phenomenal performance of Joacquin Phoenix, absolutely top acting !!"
10/10,A true Masterpiece,jashminocha,11/19/2019,"A modern Neo-noir crime drama which begs the philosophical question of acceptance in the society and dares to ask hard question on the role society plays in the making of a criminal. Beautifully acted, perfectly directed, magnificently shot, the movie transcends the genre film making with a hint scorseseism violence and story telling. The performance of joaquin phoenix is beyond imagination, the actor outdid himself."

10/10,Phoenix is a living legend now!,ormand-paul,11/15/2019,The acting was amazing!! He could not have done ANY better with the script he had. Acting 10/Script 8.5 Phoenix has become an acting legend with this movie.
10/10,A masterpiece,neitakk-1,11/15/2019,"One of the greatest movies ever made in my opinion, but not a movie everyone would understand. The layers may be too deep and inaccessible for some people. From my point of view: Great acting, fantastic production, a nerve-wracking story, morbid humor and the score is out of this world."
9/10,Wow.,chelseakaymoore,11/15/2019,The plot could've been a little more defined BUT Joaquin is phenomenal. Flawlessly done. He deserves every award possible for his performance.
10/10,A superhero movie that actually comes down to the earth and work,riadmsh,11/13/2019,"10/10. Not gonna say much! FBI, CIA, NSA all are on the lookout for Joker reviews in social media. Literally!!Joaquin Phoenix is winning the Oscar. Said and sealed."
10/10,BRILLIANT,abitens,11/9/2019,"Here's a rhetoric question - does Joaquin deserves an Oscar for this role!?To be honest, I actually don't care who else is running for the best actor in leading role, i was ready to give him Oscar after watching this movie for just 30min."
9/10,"Wow, that was some real acting",hughbo,11/9/2019,"This movie gave an insight to the picture of mental illness and how consuming it is. If people want to say this movie is ""dark"" it's the picture of that real disease. For me this movie was a true pleasure, Joaquin absolutely poured all of his talent into his role. His portrayal brought to light the real reason The Joker became such the character. His performance alone made this a must see if you are a fan of Batman."
10/10,"A Deep, Dark and Twisted Masterpiece - No Film in 2019 Comes Remotely Close",Liam3011,11/7/2019,"I will start off by saying this review will be spoiler free, as well as a minor disclaimer for those thinking about seeing Todd Phillip's Joker.If you are expecting your typical, over-done, run of the mill comic book movie. You won't find that here. This is not a film filled with jokes that either work or don't work; this isn't a movie where the heroes always win. This is a movie centered around a troubled man and his descent into madness.It is dark and, at times, horrifying. And it is an outstanding masterpiece because of that. Had this movie been toned down, it would not have been nearly as great as it is.Joker is centered around a failed, mentally-troubled comedian called Arthur Fleck. He is constantly looked down upon by society, beaten and bullied. And, as you may have guessed, this causes him to slowly lose his mind and become the Joker. That's not a spoiler, by the way. If you think that's a spoiler, look at the name and synopsis of the movie.It's filled with shocking, gruesome scenes. Tense encounters. A realistic depiction of how it is to lose sanity. And it is absolutely terrifying. A once innocent man trying to chase his dream like so many of us is beaten and bullied, or often ignored by society when it matters, becomes ones of the most notorious criminals in all of comic book history.Joaquin Phoenix delivers an Oscar-Worthy performance that rivals that of Heath Ledger. And at times? It trumps Heath Ledger's Joker. It is crazy and sadistic and, at times, honestly haunting. Terrifying, even. The writing is absolutely incredible in this movie and complements Joaquin's acting abilities. I don't think there could have been anyone better to star in this movie than him.Acting his fantastic across the board. But this review would be incredibly long if I wrote as much about them as I have Phoenix. But everyone, from top to bottom, contributed to this masterpiece extremely well.If you've not seen it already, go see it! Just do not expect this to be like anything else you have seen. It's dark, twisted and haunting. It's not a happy-go-lucky, joke filled superhero flick.10/10"
10/10,Mary Shelly runs through Joaquin Phoenix in this masterpiece,queenofrock66,10/31/2019,"This dark film was something that I knew I'd see but maybe I'd wait til streaming release but without something to do on Halloween I took myself to movies.I did not read any reviews but as I sat in cinema watching every last credit scroll up the only word that seemed fitting was Masterpiece. It seems that's a word common to describe this.The frail and yet emotionally powerful physicality of Phoenix captivates and unsettles throughout.The clever weaving of different characters' storylines in this origin tale makes complete sense and nothing feels contrived. Whether or not (perhaps especially if you are not) a fan of superhero blockbusters this film should draw you in and haunt you.Much food for thought on how society deals with difference,...not paying lip service to it..the innocence of Frankenstein, grotesque and wanting love and acceptance in a cruel world definitely echoes in this universal story.I recommend to anyone who likes to be moved not just entertained.."
10/10,Masterpiece,amirardavan,10/31/2019,One the best movie of all-time . Master performance by Jouaquin Phoenix . Powerfully directed movie .
10/10,INCREDIBLE ACTING,catanaangelo,10/27/2019,"Joaquin Phoenix definitely deserves Oscar for his acting in this film. His expressions, his laugh and his dance is what gives u thrills and goosebumps. This movie was a masterpiece and Phoenix is incredible."

10/10,Great performance and direction!,Kabor120,10/27/2019,"The joker film by Todd Phillips, is a great depiction of the famed DC villain. It added a twist unlike any joker film ever scene. The take on the character and the astonishing performance by Joaquin Phoenix, gave us a joker that we have wanted since Heath ledger. I really hope DC can develop a story that keeps the characters going in a series that we will enjoy!"
10/10,Movie of the year,georgemagas,10/27/2019,"The best movie i have ever seen in my life,honestly this movie shows real things with the best way possible.Good work DC continue like that STRONG!!!"
10/10,Masterpiece,morryggan,10/27/2019,I don't remember the last time I was so emotionally attached to a movie. This is one of the best movies I've ever watched and I'm so happy I got a chance to see it in a theatre. Perfect.
10/10,The stuff,puttbailey,10/27/2019,"This was easily the best movie I have seen in so long. It is pure art from the beginning to the end. From the camerawork, to the plot, to the acting, this movie is far better than any of the junk on the market right now. It's worth Every single penny trust me. So good. So good. Sweet Caroline so good. Enjoy this once in a. Lifetime experience boys and girl/z. You won't regret it mwah"
10/10,One of the best movies i've ever watched.,gustafvikdahl,10/25/2019,This is one of the best movies ever made in my opinion. I got chills when i left the cinema. I absolutely recommend this movie for everyone!
10/10,The making of a falling legend!,omarhshariff,10/24/2019,"This should have been the title of the movie. This is by far... the best ""the making of"" film in movie history yet.For a character that is well known and one that everyone has an opinion off, no one definitely knows how this character came to being. This version of the character development is by far the best version so far, for so many reasons.For one. Joaquin Phoenix is brilliant in this role. He embodies the very essence of what the joker has been through, through the ages, to become who he is.The script and direction of this movie is brilliant. It even gives glimpse into the very reality of why the Gotham universe is the way it is. There are so many moments in this movie that makes one realise the universe of Gotham and Batman, Of why they lead to certain events.For those batman fans who grew up reading the comics... you're in for a real treat! The screenplay and direction is superb in telling a story of the joker that develops its roots of what makes him over the edge, while also dropping crucial points on what could influence the becoming of other characters. ... things a lot of us have never realised were even connected.I can't wait for batman now and I truly can't wait for the next time batman and joker meet in this universe created by Todd Phillips. Here's hoping they do, coz I truly can't wait to see the outcome knowing what I know now, about their becoming.This is truly a film not to miss, for those new to the genre but truly love movies of substance and character, and for those who truly love the Batman universe. Go watch it now!"
10/10,Something else🤡,alexandercaspers,10/24/2019,"Just seen Joker.What can i say....I loved every second of this beautiful and depressing movie. Yes it's Phoenix from beginning til the end, but he playes Joker so convincingly, you could only feel for him, care for him and love him.(And no, i am not mentally ill)The entire movie is exceptionally well made, the story, the setting, the music and yes... Joaquin's portrayal of the joker is undoubtedly the most disturbing, I've ever seen.Do not compare with Nicholson or Ledger (still favorite) just watch and let this Joker do the laughing.No joke, the Oscar goes to....."
10/10,the joker is human!!,reneselmer,10/24/2019,"I think after ledger, that every great actor wants to play this part, todd phillips asked joaquin and here whe are!a briljant movie... will be blowing minds for a long time...nuff said"
10/10,"The film shines a mirror on society, and society does not like what it sees.",leroy_realmadrid,10/24/2019,"There is so much that can be said about this spectacular film. Those who call it boring or dismiss it for being too violent are doing their best to quantify a piece of art they are not able to completely understand. Ennui only comes through disinterest and emotional/intellectual distance. The subtleties of Phoenix's performance to some, are undercut by his denial that he did not have to give himself to the role as much as previous Jokers have had to. People want a story of struggle and pain ending with high accomplishment. But the actor achieves this with skill and mastery of his craft. I'd watch the film again and again just to enjoy how Phoenix deftly makes be believe and empathise with a sociopath, a victim of circumstance in this interpretation.Brilliant cinematography and self-conscious homages to classic Scorsese masterpieces are testament to the wider scope Joker seeks to reach. The public seem so worried about how this film could incite violence and negative behaviour. My appreciation for the artistic calibre of this film resides it its ability to incite such controversy and opinion. Instead of shouting at the screen ask yourself why you feel the way you do and question your own tendencies rather than seek to project your insecurities on the world. What a film!"
10/10,Joaquin Phoenix IS Joker.,jjenk911,10/24/2019,"There have been many a Joker - from live action adaptations and animated adaptations - and this one, by Joaquin Phoenix, is the best one next to Heath Ledger's Joker. With this film released late in the year, perhaps Phoenix is a shoo-in for Best Actor. An excellent character study of a man battling a plethora of mental illnesses. Also, for those who have seen this movie, one question remains: How much of the movie is rooted in reality, and how much of it is in Arthur Fleck's mind? It's difficult to differentiate reality from fantasy."
10/10,*This Surely Puts a Smile On My Face*,sarmadrafi,10/23/2019,"Tbh I have only one thing to say about this movie,""Justice have been served"""
10/10,A Masterpiece and critics are really off this time,ichigossplash,10/22/2019,"This movie is so incredibly well done that I am writing a comment on IMDb for the first time. I truly have no words, or more like I want to say so many things that I dont even know where to begin.Please watch it if you havent already, its the best thing you'll watch in a long time."
10/10,"Horribly brilliant, I wish I could unsee this film and watch it again.",omer_a_uk,10/22/2019,"Joaquin Phoenix is excellent, this is the best movie you will see this year.This movie is a visual treatise on mental heath, abuse and social marginalisation. It has not much to do with DC and the fictional character. It perfectly explores how a human being can unravel into a sociopath. They could have easily called it 'Making a madman' or something.Not sure why they picked the 1980s but it worked well, the music is excellent and quite diverse in parts. Grimy downtrodden NY/Gotham looks awesome and suits the story.Heath Ledger was excellent previously but this film is rooted in brutal reality and it is so different to everything that came before that it is justified as a standalone masterpiece."
10/10,most important message of tis time - better then Ledger?,tomhiggins-82642,10/21/2019,"This movie is astonishing,This movie managed to tie all loose ends. The outstanding acting makes the movie so much more believable and realistic, and every character is designed perfectly and have major role in the plot.The camera shots in this film are perfect, mostly wide blurred shots slowly creeping in making it so much more disturbing.Plot - This movie is so disturbing and gritty just as it should be, it shows what really can happen in life when a person with mental health issues or even a healthy person that has hit rock bottom and has no one to help them 'back' up.The message is perfect for the times we live in, in 2019, the rich and healthy should not be separated from the sick and poor; from the mentally challenged. We should live in a society where anyone can be helped and anyone can be heard no matter what level they stand at, before they spiral."
10/10,A cinematic achievement in the 100 years of cinema.,samirrashid101,10/18/2019,"JOKER 2019Joaquin Phoenix, Todd Philips & Scott Silver's JOKER is the ULTIMATE punchline to the 'joke' called society. It is a bold, raw, devastating and hauntingly beautiful character study, a social commentary and a flawless masterpiece - a cinematic achievement in the 100 years of cinema. It unfolds very very slowly but as it does, it punches you in the guts, punches you hard.Let me go back to one and a half year or more ago when they announced the movie. Being a hardcore Joker fan, I wasn't overly excited as I knew (as did everyone) that it is not possible to outdo Heath Ledger's performance as Joker. I was still intrigued as I heard Martin Scorcese was involved and Joaquin Phoenix was cast as the role with Robert De Niro in it. I wanted that different, crime-driven version. Then, over the course of last 12 months LOTs and LOTs of leaked photos and behind-the-scenes footages came out, and I wasn't quite liking what I saw. The production team seemed lazy as per security and keeping secret, something someone like Christopher Nolan wouldn't do. Then I heard that the script was being rewritten almost every day (which is usually a recipe for disaster) and my expectations were further down and it wasn't even my most anticipated this year, then there was the matter of confidence on Director Todd Philips who directed the crime-driven comedy 'The Hangover'. THEN, the unexpected happened and we got to see the first trailer and the second. And then, last month, the reviews came in, the movie won an 8 minute standing ovation from Venice Film Festival screening and won the 'Golden Lion'. Some of the hardest reviewers gave it full marks and called it either a masterpiece, or a cinematic achievement, or that a comic book movie has never been done in such way, and this opens up new doors and changes the movie industry forever. Well....whatever you heard and read are all true.Joaquin Phoenix gave a performance that cannot be described in words, even if I talk about it in person I will fail to describe it. I have never seen any performance like this, and I watch a LOT of cinemas. He did something impossible to the character that left us all awestruck and in disbelief. His version of Joker is of course different (the greatness of Joker character is - it is multi layered and can be approached in different ways) but if I'd have to compare it, it goes on par with Heath Ledger's Joker or maybe even outshines him. If I consider the best actors (Oscar Winners) for the last few years namely, Matthew Mcconaughey, Mahershala Ali, or Rami Malek, they were all brilliant but Phoenix outshines them all (little known fact, Phoenix did almost all his shots in single takes :O). Joaquin Phoenix has BECOME Joker. My sincere gratitude to Todd Philips, as whatever rewrites and plans he did, it came out as a beautiful bright art. It took him a whole year to convince Warner Brothers to greenlight the movie and 5 visits to Joaquin Phoenix's house to convince him. His depiction of Gotham city is raw, filthy and perfect. Cinematography also is Oscar worthy and so is the story. Hildur Guðnadóttir's unforgettable score for the movie not only is a perfection but it almost literally talks to you during moments, especially during times when you're confused as to what is going on inside Arthur Fleck's (Joker) mind.Joaquin Phoenix's Joker will sadden you, cheer you, scare you, haunt you, and finally leave you scarred. Yes this movie is not for everyone and of course children should definitely avoid it. In the end, you will not know how much of it you can believe or was real, it leaves you to your imagination. So if you think this Joker has a definitive origin as opposed to Heath Ledger's mysterious Joker.....wrong, it leaves you to interpret it on your own way. When there is chaos we always try to point it all to someone, in JOKER though you wouldn't know whether you should point you finger to the society or Joker himself. When everything spirals out of control do you still endure it, or do you cross that thin line, or do you put a bullet through your head, what would YOU do given the same situation, because Arthur Fleck is one of us. Therein lies the mastery of the movie. During the final punchline of it you will roar as we all did - WE ARE ALL CLOWNS, LET'S PUT ON A HAPPY FACE.As Arthur would say ""I used to think my life was a tragedy, now I know it's a comedy"", apart from what this line represents, the final shot of the movie ends with a comedy. This movie will win multiple awards and Oscars as per my prediction and will be talked about for years. Indeed, one of the greatest cinematic achievement created with a $ 55 million budget. Don't wait for blu-ray, run to the theaters and believe me, it is worth every single penny of yours. This movie is disturbingly real, and relatable.I've seen it 3 times already and still stuck with the HAHAs in my head. I'm giving it a 10/10."
10/10,"Not only is this a masterpiece, but Phoenix totally rivals Ledger",michaeldjoyce,10/16/2019,Saw this movie in the after noon the week after it's release. Yea very disturbing and unsettling but what do you expect from a movie that has a mentally psycho clown in the front and center? I freaking loved every minute of this movie. Even Gotham looked fantastic and I think this is the best looking Gotham ever. Sorry Chris Nolan even though you made the best Batman films. Phoenix really sold it. His portrayal of the Joker was completely realistic and all of his laughs were so well done. The story was great as well. I highly recommend this film
10/10,WTF is wrong with the media,wissbra,10/16/2019,"Everything that has to be praised has. Joaquin's performance and psychological angle. But, the media seems to think the message of the movie is to spread violence and chaos. It's not, the message is to show kindness and compassion to others because you're negative actions could create a new joker."
10/10,Masterpiece - Joaquin deserves the Oscar,andreeappopescu,10/16/2019,"Best Movie of the year. A must see for all cinema fans. Joaquin's performance is mind blowing. Joker is ""the rare comic book movie that expresses what's happening in the real world"". I see it as a good representation for today's bullying and how evil, we are as human beings."
10/10,In the presence of true genius,ivorybow,10/15/2019,"I left the theater stunned speechless. There really isn't an adequate way to describe Phoenix's genius portrayal of the Joker. I can say there were an abundance of moments when the hair on my arms literally stood up, moments when I could not breathe. See this movie for no other reason than to watch the mastery of his work. We will never meet or know a character like Joker, but Phoenix will bring you as close as you can be to true madness without losing your life. If he does not receive the Oscar for this role, it is only because of fear."
10/10,Jaw Dropping!,mrscottboudreau,10/14/2019,"From beginning to end, Joker will have all of your attention and you will be blown away. An origin for the ages! Dark, stark, harsh and real."

10/10,Send in the Clowns,ajinthomas-38977,10/13/2019,"Scrolling down Instagram and Facebook you might come across this quote ""Put on a happy face"", ""Whenever happens you should smile"" and this quotes are the main theme of JOKER. The film begins with Arthur aka joker laughing and you can feel every emotion joker's laugh had except the emotion of happiness cause joker is not happy from inside and that's why he is going under 7 medications even though if it's not helping him. Acting - Acting is top notch, it's something you might have never seen before. Joaquin phoenix is quite old in age and that's why in close up you can see linings on his face and you can see how those linings make his laugh, and sadness more effective. With facial expressions there are macro expressions which you can notice on close up and those macro expressions shows the class of acting this guy has done. Music - Background music is top notch the song ""Send in the clowns"" fits perfectly with the theme and in some part the background score so perfect that it glorify the scene for example the scene where Arthur is checking his gun n there is this music played in TV shows which helps to intensify the mood. Makeup and lighting is even perfect after The dark knight if there's something everyone was talking the most after heath ledger's acting then it's his makeup. He himself did the makeup so it can be realistic and in this Joker makeup is good, simple, subtle and perfect according to the script, some small details makes you a fan of the make up artist like painting a kind of tear drop under the eye bags and at some places the right eye's blue colour is slightly spread because of joker's tears. The lighting makes you feel it's a 90's setting and dark film. Unpredictable storyline - Just like Spiderman far from home this film has lots of surprises for you and you cannot say what will happen next, anything can happen at any point and it is so balanced that you don't feel like there is too many surprises. The first half is quite slow but makes you feel pity over Arthur, the mental and laughing condition of Arthur and the way the people treats him makes you question about your way of treating people like that. The best thing of the film is it hasn't shown Joker has a hero they have shown him, it has shown him as a person who is the biggest villian of Batman and the reason behind his attitude. The film leaves the descision on you wheather what he is doing right or not and everything in the film is perfect and balanced and you cannot argue on that. If you like to see dark film and writes stories or you wanna be an actor then this is a must watch."

10/10,Loop Movie,nunoficafe,10/13/2019,"Well, this review will not contain any spoilers, although I must say, if you read it, just don't complain me for this poor society that we live in. This is, with absolutely no doubt, one of the movies of the century, one of the movies that has no precedent, just art, just a true show about the real downsides of this society, and still, humanity keeps failing, over and over again...I already know, that we (humans), don't have the same tastes, the same ideologies, and the same problems, but it's a bit shameful see the younger, just arguing (and with no real arguments whatsoever), that this movie is just boring, non interesting, and non relevant.Sometimes, we have to grow, to understand the real sadness, to understand the madness, the provocative world that we live in, but unfortunately some of the youngest have real problems, and I've already been there.For those who find this movie quite forgettable, just leave the cinema, and continue to see your favourite movies.For those, who can't get the job done (like, reading some info), before the movie session, try to do so on a future visit.Art is art.

10/10,Austerity in society hitting those most vulnerable.,seanbronwen,10/13/2019,"A brilliant use of current problems in capitalist societies, sheer the rich want to get even richer and so they demand governments and councils use austerity on the masses to fuel tax cuts for the rich.One specific result is the cuts to services that help those with mental illness. Hence Joaquin Phoenix's character depends into an abyss from which the Joker emerges.The dance sequence down the long set of steps to the Glitter Bands Rock and Roll (part 1 & 2), beats anything Fred Astaire could do.If Joaquin Phoenix doesn't get an Oscar for this, then scrap the Oscars."
10/10,The film is very beautiful. I think I will not watch a movie of this level in the next five years,dms707,10/13/2019,The film is very beautiful. I think I will not watch a movie of this level in the next five years
10/10,Unforgettable,mochi-19872,10/13/2019,It was masterpiece. This movie there just like once in years. DC once again make another good quality movie after dark knight. And I've watch it on theatre more than twice. Beautiful. Beautiful.
10/10,Amazing Movie about mental illness with the make up of JOKER!,hunterboyd-90637,10/13/2019,"If you enjoyed Taxi Driver then go see this film. Simple as that. Don't listen to anyone else about how dark or violent it is because everyone has a had a dark time in their life that they tried to be ""happy"" through."
10/10,Brilliant and unexpected!,greenpencil-11706,10/12/2019,"The Joker is just brilliant!! the plot of the story is excellent. Deep story touched your soul and make ur mind think! Much respect to the directer Todd Phillips 👏👏 he's just genius! And Joaquin Phoenix is just insane! He deserves to get the Oscar for his Super top performance and great acting in this movie 👌👏.. Also the music was nice.. Everything was great, It is one of the best movies i ever seen in all time, I really enjoyed it and you must watch it if you are looking for real story! Nothing to say more! 🤡"
10/10,Phenomenal acting by Joaquin Phoenix makes this film A Masterpiece!,ravikumarbb11,10/12/2019,"Eversince Phoenix was attached to play the iconic Joker, I was eagerly waiting for this film. I had high expectations in terms of acting in the film and I was completely blown away after seeing it. This film is the best of the year and will be a cult classic in coming years. Direction is near perfect and cinematography is beautifully poetic as expected from a DC movie. You dive into the 80s Gotham and see the world through Arthur's eyes. You witness his transformation into the Joker and the reasons behind it. The end of the movie will make you think what's real and what's fantasy as they say joker has a multiple origin stories. Not sure about Best Picture but expect Academy Award for the Best Actor for Joaquin Phoenix."
10/10,Current and essential viewing,prasadgollakota,10/12/2019,"Where to begin. An essential story that had to be told. Not because its the Joker. Not because its DC or Batman related. Because it is current.What is more important for film than to lure with one illusion, only to present something unexpected yet essential. The Joker does this effortlessly. Even if the Joker wasn't a well known character this production would have worked. The movie presents a picture for something very prevalent in global western society today; the disintegration of societal values, structure, and security and its human impact on the less privileged in society.Arthur is the ultimate anti-hero and through his journey emerges as perhaps a more powerful hero than his arch nemesis to be. A David v Goliath type story. A hero is after all someone who stands up for the weak, injustice and those who cant stand up for themselves; Arthur has these traits, though not in a conventional sense. The weak in his story is him; what greater hero than someone who stands up for themselves and emerges triumpant ? My statement will of course have many people screaming given Arthur's chosen methods. What underlies it all is a person fighting back the only way they know how, once they've been pushed too far; at the story's core, Arthur is simply screaming for ""help"".What about mental health you shout? He is totally messed up and off his meds. Of course, because mental health is just something that is the cause not the result? Mental health is correlated to societal values, function and security. Arthur's mental health is the result of his environment, so we are all to blame for Arthur's situation."
10/10,Deserve Oscar,gabrijeltokic,10/12/2019,"By far the best movie this year. This should be the starting story of creating the Joker. It's supposed to make a new movie where it relaxes that tension and creates a sick mind of something resembling the Heath ledger joker. Where he becomes a psychopath but leads a group of people off the street and is the most evil supervillain. This type of dancing smoke bomb, pistol and all those magician clown stuff that go with it. With some kind of horror puzzle mix, but it hasn't been copied."
10/10,An all time classic was just made.,debroop,10/12/2019,"Loved it. Hard to describe. It is rare these days that they make a movie that is more art than commercial. Phoenix's acting is sublime. He makes you feel familiar with the character. Like you know him personally, feel his pain.This is going to go down as an all time classics and one of the darkest movies of our era."
10/10,A must see Drama\Thriller movie,rotem-rose,10/12/2019,"It's rare for me to give a movie 10 stars, but Joker is totally worth it.It is a very strong drama movie that won't let you move your eyes for a second. the music and sounds affects are genius,adding a lot to the general atmosphere - first when you get to know the Jokerand how everything is going horribly wrong.It got to the part of the movie that there are supposedly comedy parts, but the director wants you to feel how it is wrong and not really funny.The movie really make you get to know the joker's personality and creeps you out.I watched it yesterday and I still get chills up my spine thinking of some of the scenes."
10/10,Can you combine a powerful story with a deep drama in a comic book movie?,MrWoall,10/12/2019,"Normally, it helps me more to put DC or Marvel movies under a different category from other movies to be fair when I rate them, but this one was really on another level. A great script that gave us a deep story, well-organized chapters, superb acting performance and yes it was based on comics!Even though it's a slow-paced movie, I didn't feel like there's a slow buildup in any chapters, which is not easy to avoid in these kinds of dark drama movies. Joaquin took the movie to another level, and it's really fair enough to say it's 'Joaquin's movie'. He really made every scene counted on the screen. I can't remember any scene was there just to help the story, not his character. Everything in the movie should be about him, and that's what he did.When I watched the movie in the cinema, there were mixed emotions between the audience for most of the scenes. You don't know if you should laugh? or feel sad. These stressful situations were greatly made with the help of Joaquin's performance. He was always in control of these kinds of situations and when things require outsourcing support, the soundtrack comes in the right moment. Hildur made a great job by giving the soundtrack theme a character that I felt personally it's a little bit inspired by Hans Zimmer's masterpiece the Dark Knight, but with a more slow pace and dark feel.I liked how during each chapter there were these scenes that look like some encaustic or painting to recap the joker personality changes.Some people are saying the story is not 100% loyal to the comic, but what's wrong with that? Make a nice movie and implement all film success factors then I'm more than satisfied.The only thing that I felt is not 100% complete after watching the movie for the second time is the last 20 min. I think it was necessary for an extra 15 or a maximum of 20 min for the last Joker personality transformation. But maybe the writer wanted to focus on what things that made the Joker as he is instead of the Joker himself. So yeah it's fine.I know there are obvious ideas that can be reflected in other ones in the Taxi Driver movie, but it's really been used brilliantly. If someone watched the two movies and focused on the last Joker chapter, he will understand why I'm saying that.It's really hard - without considering the comics' loyalty thing - to not give this film a full mark. It's been years since I watched a deep movie like this one.I had a big question after I finished the movie, what's wrong in having a good script that leaves the freedom for actors to give a stunning performance in superhero movies? What's wrong with a good deep story instead of just counting on CGI? A lot of people are really starving for a well-written drama superhero movie. I hope Joker can help in this direction."
10/10,Masterpiece,dionysislarson,10/12/2019,"Damn, just,,, damn! This is my first review, probably because this is the first movie since I signed up that motivated me to do so. It's also the third movie that I've given a perfect rating for. At my age (44), I exclusively watch comic book, Science Fiction, Science Fantasy and Fantasy. If I want Drama, all I need to do is analyze life, I want films to take me someplace unknown. With Joker I mistakenly thought that I would be getting a comic book movie, how wrong I was a pleasantly surprised too.I have no other way to describe Joker than to say it is a masterpiece. Everyone involved in its making gets top marks from me and my thanks."
10/10,Fantastic,amun-75278,10/12/2019,"Specifically created an account to give this a rating. 10 stars might be too high, but 9 stars felt too low so I will give it 10 stars. The cinematography, music and acting is all absolutely top notch. The movie grips you from start to end, bravo!"

10/10,Absolutely incredible!,dhiren-adatia,10/12/2019,"Joaquin Phoenix truly deserves to win an Oscar for this. To act and perform the way as the ""Joker"" was special! I don't think any other actor could of done it the way he did. He touched everybody's soul and the film has a meaning to it. It gives a chance for people to realise that mental illness is a thing. Never judge a person and to be kind to one another because you just never know what a person is going through.10/10"
10/10,Masterpiece!,totti-87315,10/12/2019,"I was reading DC Comics since 10, I am 37 now and I can say that this version of the Joker is almost as good as Heath Ledgers one!The Joker character is such a complex and disturb one but is so difficult to dislike him, it has such a range of personalities and is so charismatic...I enjoyed so much Jack Nicholson as the Joker, I idolize the Ledgers one and honestly this one is almost as good..., Depends on the taste I should say, like a good wine or art... But even if you don't know nothing about this character or comics is a must see! The performances are outstanding, the plot is tremendous and the most important thing it shows so many faces of our society! A must!"

10/10,Wow,mtalous,10/11/2019,"This is such an important film. Not just for an amazing look into the depths of a character we know little about but also for awareness of how we act around others and mental illness. A great film; dark, twisted and a story that's beautifully told and shot. An abolute masterpiece of modern cinema."
10/10,A smile on the face,juantrash,10/11/2019,"For years is No Country for Old Men my #1 movie of all time. Anton Chigurh still makes me freak out every time he flips his coin. Is not different in this movie.Actually I have the same feeling watching Joker and the second time I went to the movie it felt like it was even faster ended, which is a good thing.Jomer is raw, painfull and has a very good message to the world. If you don't get your eyes opened after watching this, it can be the other critics got their message right, which is to not let you see what's going on 'til today.About No Country for Old Men: it still has a special place in my heart, but I am pretty sure Joker will stay as #1 for a long time."
10/10,Work or art,carlostinocomfrm,10/11/2019,Best movie I've seen in a long time. I didn't think there would ever be another Joker as good as Heath Ledger's adaptation (may he rest in peace) but this movie proved me wrong.
10/10,UNBELIEVABLE! Ignore critic reviews,brodycunliffe,10/11/2019,"Despite the fact that I went into this film with very high expectations I was still blown out of the water. Joaquin was amazing, the cinematography was outstanding and the writing was so perfectly linked to Christopher Nolan's batman trilogy. How this is rated poorly by critics blows my mind it clearly shows that critics are biased. Some bad reviews spoke about how the film was too dark and sadistic but that's merely the whole point of joker. He portrays a sadistic psychopath who has been pushed around in an unforgiving place and causes him to rebel. 10/10 best film of the year."
10/10,I just wanna say,larbidinari,10/11/2019,This movie is an absolute piece of art I've never been Soo happy and thrilled to see a movie until thisit's defrent and real and just amazing
10/10,Something refreshingly different from DC,colinnjenkins,10/11/2019,"Despite being a DC movie, this is not your typical superhero vs. villain CGI fest.This is a film about a man with mental illness who has suffered abuse, neglect and intolerance and his eventual decline into criminal insanity.If you enjoy movies like Scorsese's Taxi Driver or King of Comedy, then this is for you. If your expecting another Dark Knight, you will be disappointed.It's set in a beautifully shot dark and bleak Gotham City and is an absolute masterclass in acting from Joaquin Phoenix."
10/10,Oscar-worthy and Movie of the Decade,cristianjreyes,10/11/2019,"This movie is truly a modern masterpiece. Joaquin Phoenix does justice to Joker where Heath Ledger left off. But I wouldn't want to compare both their performances as many have already said, ""It would be like comparing apples to oranges."" But I at least know that Heath Ledger can rest easy in heaven knowing Joaquin brought the character under a new light with his phenomenal performance. Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix have really outdone themselves with this new take on The Joker. Joaquin and Todd bring a whole new aspect to Joker that has never really been talked about before, tackling the issue and importance of mental illness and a few other problems with modern society. And to address all the fear-mongering the media throws towards this movie, ignore it. Most of it isn't even relevant towards the actual movie and much of it are lies. I couldn't recommend another movie to watch over Joker. This movie will not disappoint. In fact, it goes above expectations (surely went over mine). Case in point, please consider giving this film a watch. I can't recommend this movie enough."

10/10,Must watch if you like character study films or find mental illnesses fascinating.,katariinn,10/11/2019,"It's very interesting to watch a talented actor depict a compelling and unique character falling into madness. This kind of movie heavily depends on the actor's performance so I was worried if Joaquin could pull it off, but he really exceeded my expectations.One of those movies that I couldn't get enough of after watching it, don't think I'll get easily tired of discussing about the it and watching clips or the whole thing again."
10/10,Outstanding performance,evanescence_999999,10/11/2019,"The movie is too dark, awkwardness leaks in every single minute of it...However, it delivers a very clear and strong message that cannot be mistaken.The purely genuine performance of the Joker adds to its darkness & beauty."
10/10,Outstanding Movie,jjrl,10/11/2019,I went along to this thinking it was a Marvel type offering. How wrong I was. Totally immersed in this film to the point of being overwhelmed by emotion.One of the best movie experiences I have ever had.

10/10,Dripping with style and substance...,youcanprosperfromhome,10/11/2019,"Todd Phillip's Joker is strange, gripping, and unlike the films it shares its comic book category. Grounded by a world that's hard to look at, littered with sure-to-be-iconic character shots, fueled by a heart breaking performances, and sewn together by a near perfect score; Joker is sure to both divide and captivate audiences for decades to come"
10/10,Decade defining masterpiece. Anything short of an Oscar would be a disservice.,walter-08224,10/10/2019,"I came into the theater expecting to be a bit disappointed. Seeing people in droves rate this movie as a masterpiece made me think this would be another overblown DC flick but my low expectations were put to shame. This is a film that is unlike anything i have seen in the past years. This is a visceral, haunting film that will be very difficult to forget. My eyes were practically glued to the screen. I didn't want to miss a single detail. Seeing Arthur Fleck's transformation into the Clown Prince of Gotham is downright masterful. I cannot recall character development done so effectively, yet realistically. You comprehend Fleck's motives, even if you don't agree with the harsh extent to which he takes them. You see how society could craft such an individual. How our society could isolate and destroy an Arthur Fleck. Although Fleck has mental issues, within the first half of the film he wishes to cause no harm and only wants to follow his dream to make people laugh. Of course the majority of credit has to go to Joaquin Phoenix. His work is tremendous. The laugh, the mannerisms. Phoenix portrays Fleck like a real person. A tormented person who has received much trauma over his life, and how a series of unfortunate events finally cause him to snap. How he tried to smile through the pain until the pain made him smile. It's a brilliant performance that deserves every award across the board. I never thought someone could come close to Ledger's work, but Phoenix possibly surpasses Ledger. I could go into great detail about the terrific music choices, the score, the cinematography which captures Gotham oh so well, the directing, and even De Niro's work. Everything clicked. There's no false not. It built to a such a powerful climax i had goosebumps among a crowded theater. This is a decade defining film, and one unlike anything you'll see again in quite some time. Let's hope the Oscars do the right thing."

10/10,A hug,lucasdieguez,10/8/2019,"I did not find a single scene that I did not like, the photography in this movie is excellent. I cried in the beginning, I only laughed 3 or 4 times (no forced jokes) and i left the cinema complete. You see the side b of gotham's past and although you can empathize with Arthur but only the politically correct thing could complain about such a jewel, it bothers them but we love it. The comic genre needs more movies like this and less comedy."
10/10,Who's laughing now?,johnny-08,10/8/2019,"Modern America is like Murray show where opinions are created for greater masses & every difference is looked upon with contempt. Such is mindless campaign to boycott a movie because it will provoke violence in a country where gun can be bought while shopping for groceries.Joker is examination of people's behavior towards those in need, sick individuals who are pushed to the margins just because they need help. While city is choking in garbage, funds are being cut on social help & medical care, elite in suits are smiling while watching Chaplin. Wayne is not different then the others and he's finally given human approach rather then all good hero that tried to save Gotham in all other creations.There are no heroes in this movie, there is no light at the end of tunnel & there is no sympathy for titular character but rather a big punch in the face from Todd Phillips to all of us who are actually living in our own Murray show day in day out without ever taking time to reflect what surrounds us.Joker is a must see movie that will make you think about times we live in, about our role in the system & the ones on top never liked ordinary thinking people. Burton took his Joker straight from comics as he fell in acid, but Phillips only needed to put his protagonist in today's world.So who's laughing now?"
10/10,A MUST WATCH!! One of the best movies of all-time,thetenbagger,10/7/2019,"""you are making fun of it, but it was serious to me""dem this scene still gives me chills since last night.its rare to spot a good thriller with a decent suspense and ending nowadays, guess Christopher Nolan has raised the bar too high.but maaaan, Joaquin and Todd have just proved me wrong, Joker wasn't just great, but motha-****ingly AMAZING. The performance, cinematography, screenplay, storyline, music etc were absolutely stunning. It's not just a movie but also a whistleblower, a HUGE message to the world out there of what's still going on in our society.you can't compare Joaquin to Heath, they are both Ronaldo and Messi. If Joaquin doesn't win the Oscar and Joker doesn't win AT LEAST the best screenplay, it'll be the biggest joke of all time.Joker is something else."

DC films haven't been the greatest over the past lot of years and here we are again with WB trying to go down another route to try and make something of it...Well - I'm only glad they did.Joker is quite simply one of the finest pieces of film I have seen in a long time - especially from Hollywood, which isn't too often. From Joaquin's incredible performance (just amazing), to the stunning cinematography and score, I just can't think of a single moment that lost me.Well done Todd Phillips and team, and well done Joaquin for the greatest performance of the Joker ever!"

I have been waiting for this movie since Joaquin Phoenix's laughing trailer came out, and i am more than happy to see well worth the wait. Phoenix's performance is hard to forget and we are lucky to see this performance with a great script on the big screen.We watched Batman saving Gotham and sad background of Bruce Wayne's life million times. This film shows and asks a simple question; what if Gotham deserves Joker more than Batman?Lastly; Joaquin Phoenix should win Oscar after this. I don't think any other option would be fair."

The script, the ""connections"" (you'll understand), the acting (my god... what a acting!), the story and even the music.Heath Ledger Joker was perfect until yesterday.Now perfection was updated for me.See the movie!"
1/10,Irresponsible Filmmaking at its Finest,georgepransdon,10/29/2019,"This was irresponsible filmmaking at its finest coming at the worst possible time. Todd Phillips should be ashamed. He had the opportunity to offer a positive message to people that see themselves in Arthur's shoes- people that have been wronged by the system and see no way out- and instead he reassured them that they are monsters and the only way they can ""win"" is if they get back at the society that wronged them in any way they can. He's a cash grabber that used his platform to tell an entertaining Joker story, instead of a deeper resonate message like it could have been. From an outsider's view, one could argue that this scenario is what happens when society fails, but this was not told from an outsider's view. This was told from the terribly empathetic Arthur's view, and so I see no reason why a potential school shooter wouldn't relate to him. This is saying to that person, it's better to be infamous than a nobody. It's a very dangerous message at this current time. For those that argue, it's only art, I argue that the mainstream media is potentially the most powerful force in the entire world. Personally, I feel that with great power comes great responsibility. Media makers have the right to make whatever they want, but they have the responsibility to use the power they've been given for good and this was completely the opposite...Objective review: Beautifully shot and acted, but super boring at times."

10/10,Modern masterpiece - has got right under my skin!,jboutflour,10/7/2019,"I would consider myself an avid film fan and in my 37 years, I have been privileged to watch many classic films that have an x-factor and capture the zeitgeist at the time. Some films are just beautifully put together and the combination of image and sound work together to create something more than its parts.Joker has the x-factor and works almost perfectly as a film. Seeing as perfect doesn't exist, this is as good as it gets. Throw in a performance on a Daniel Day-Lewis level and you have something very special. It clearly draws from Scorsese's work in the 1970s (Taxi Driver, The King of Comedy etc) but also has a very relevant social commentary about mental illness, the rich/poor divide and shared responsibility.The critical backlash after the initial praise is strange, but feels like a concerted effort to distance themselves from a film that could be too hot to handle. However, the people clearly disagree and the universal praise is totally deserving.This is a transportative and transformative film that looks backwards to redefine a genre and create a gem of a film. It's dark, depressing and glorious all at the same time."
10/10,Better than Heath Ledger!!!,kabraham23,11/18/2019,Yes I am that blown away by Joaquin! But I am not surprised! When I found out they casted him I was like PERFECT CHOICE!!!!!!!!! He actually got me to become a fan of Johnny Cash! My fav scene is the dancing on the steps! Hilarious! I love everything about it!
3/10,Too venerable to be the Joker,MovieGenerator,11/1/2019,"The origin of the crazy story is a Space odyssey. The masterpiece is a Taxi driver. The origin of reality-fantasy confusion movies is Rashomon. The masterpiece is Mulholland Drive. And this movie is too boring compared to them.I'm a writer and I couldn't help to think where it was wrong ... I think the Joker was too passive. If you write a hero who only accidentally meets unhappiness or some unfortunate encounter, nobody follow your story. After all, the hero must make an effort like a hero. Even if the hero made much efforts but no effect because of the social twist, people will expect that he will go wrong if you got hint in advance that he has cut out for doing bad things. If he knew he has the gift but he hold it out by his conscience, but after all these events...if I were the writer I would have wrote like that."
10/10,Incredible,inmh-29096,10/23/2019,"The first time I've come out of the cinema in a long time feeling satisfied, excited and amazed. Joaquin Phoenix carries the whole movie, with his portrayal of the joker being immersive and entertaining. Every aspect was amazing- great choice of songs, brilliant acting and beautiful cinematography. So impressed!"
10/10,Never been so captivated by a movie before,ericpitcher-15519,10/19/2019,"This movie or Shawshank Redemption takes the number 1 spot of my favorite movies. Seen it in thereaters twice. Masterpiece, well done Joaquin Phoenix, supreme acting. He must get an Oscar for this!I cannot wait for Joker 2.10/10"
10/10,Possibly the best movie of all time,CatDayAfternoon,10/15/2019,"I haven't been this obsessed with a movie since I saw Taxi Driver 30 years ago...and my obsession for Joker surpasses it in spades. Everyone else has said all there is to say, I can't really add to it other than to say it almost feels pointless to go to the movies after seeing this because it's impossible for anything to compare. I can't explain why it's so good, you just have to see it. The directing, cinematography, music, screenplay, and of course the jaw dropping acting....everything about it is flawless. The timing of the film is uncomfortable, yes, but I think it's needed. Joker doesn't teach us to be violent. It teaches us to STOP BEING SUCH ***HOLES TO EACH OTHER.I understand that not everyone will connect with this film or ""get it"". And you're not supposed to. This is a film for those who relate to it in some way and not everyone will. But if you do, if you get it, you won't ever see a more remarkable and all consuming film. It's truly astonishing filmmaking.And if it doesn't sweep every category at the Oscars because of controversy then shame on the Academy and shame on everyone voting."
10/10,A masterpiece like no other.,ravingpain,10/12/2019,"First of all I will say it from the get go, go see this movie. There isn't a single thing missing. The direction, the cinematography, the acting, the scores and the feelings that this movie portrays all blend together perfectly to create the masterstroke that this movie is. Many critics keep complaining that ""there isn't a clear point"" that the movie tries to make and it confuses me. The society's marginalization of people with mental illnesses and the unjust economical inequalities are for me the crystal-clear points that this movie made. Cinematography at it's purest form. This movie is a gem like no other. 10/10."
10/10,Master-peace...,azizrakhmanov,10/12/2019,"Guys just go and watch it in cinemas, this is a master-peace. I dont have any words to say, incredible work. Thank you."
10/10,Absolutely Fantastic,lucasccmf,10/12/2019,"It's hard to believe someone doesn't understand the violence and the villain formation in this movie. The script doesn't try to make the idea of a redeemer violence it's a lunatic story, it touches in sensible points about human mind and our destructive behaviors. Transcendental, Joker is the truly villain, not just a purple guy snapping fingers."
10/10,This time Oscar is definitely yours.,punkjr-47011,10/12/2019,"You finished a very great performance, I just want to say thank you Joaquin Phoenix!!!"
9/10,An amalgam of emotions,hemanthr-87796,10/12/2019,"Joker takes you on an emotional, disturbing yet a magnificent journey. Joaquin Phoenix puts on another brilliant show and the greatest character continues to live on as the favorite super villian."
10/10,Be polite and kind to everyone.,Hemraj,10/11/2019,"The one lesson I learnt from this movie is only if he had one person whom he could his friend, Joker would have had something going for him.Be nice to people, you might be the only one for a person."
10/10,Best Movie from DC so far,aryawibitomo,10/11/2019,"Finally DC movie who come with DC's DNA since Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy, superb action from Phoenix and 'out of the box' plot, something that Marvel will struggle with...."
10/10,What an amazing performance!,cyber-ibiza,10/11/2019,"I can't find words to describe Phoenix performance, just amazing! What a movie"
10/10,"As a fan of comics and good cinema, Wow!",armandomedinadelgado,10/11/2019,"As a lifelong fan of western comics, anime, TV sci-fi and cult & masterpiece movies, this film truly is a historical landmark of cinema. Kudos to Mr. Phoenix and Mr. Phillips, they have achieved something no one else had until now in the superhero genre, true art (Except maybe Nolan's and Ledger's Dark Knight).Superhero-wise, this Joker has been brought to us under an entirely different light. He makes you feel sorry for him, mad at society for having forsaken such a hurt man. Appaled of how the system can abandon a sick and lonely person in the time of most need. Truly despicable are crowds of people who mock a man dressed as a clown with a smile, but who cries inside. A cruel, bitter and tasteless joke this is."
10/10,Amazing tragedy,raymondmceldran,10/11/2019,"Dark, twisted and amazingly disturbing. Arthur is such a complex character. This movie isn't just abou t him as a character but an example of how a mentally ill person lives and wants to be normal. I have a mental illness as well and I relate to Arthur perfectly, people have let me down, I've felt like my life was worth nothing. And we mentally ill people we just want to be noticed and understood, and that's what Arthur really wanted in his life, I perfectly relate to him. This film also tells us how bullying can affect the victim and what a cruel world this is. Otherwise, the film felt heavy and tragic. I watched it 2 days ago and it's still bugging in my head. Could definitely watch it again."
10/10,The best movie of 2019,hmingtei,10/11/2019,"This movie is phenomenal. Joaquin Phoenix didn't just play the Joker, he became the joker and the slow burn story was not boring if anything it was the perfect rendition of how the Joker came to be. So realistic that you feel bad for Arthur Fleck and you just wanna give him a hug."
9/10,The mirror of society,darkjedi-70396,10/10/2019,Acting 10/10Actors 10/10Sound 8/10Soundtrack 9/10Dolby Atmos 6/10Drama 9/10Action 3/10Suspense 9/10Story 10/10Conclusion:When you ever want to know why exist joker and batman you must see this film.Jaquin phoenix play his role very intense he play the feelings of the character authentic i never think about that the character is not real i look outside and i can find one normal person who can have the problems from the playing character. Joker is more than a dc story joker is the mirror of the society.
10/10,A masterful play between the lines of insanity and tragedy,calico180,10/10/2019,"This truly is Phoenix's magnum opus. Few films are able to have such strongly resonating and impactful displays of violence that over the span of the film, through such an emotionally developed character, creates an uneasy feeling of genuine consequence to each driving action that Arthur performs in the creation of his alter ego.Phoenix's performance is so unnervingly raw the viewer is left perplexed by the deep insight into the constantly decaying mind of the man behind the makeup. A pleasantly surprising dedication to a role prior known only to fans of the character as a chaotic evil."
10/10,Simply Brilliant,sriramch-83467,10/10/2019,"The whole movie, starting from the very first scene, connects to you deeply. It is a rare movie, I'd say, these kind of movies are made once in a century. It has all kinds of emotions, lows and highs, ups and downs, everything. The way they connect the story between Arthur Fleck (early Joker) & kid Bruce Wayne (Batman in future) made so much sense and had so much meaning to it. The script, story, screenplay, direction, everything in the movie was on point. The Music Director - Hildur Guðnadóttir completely nailed the BGM.I don't think we can find any fault in the movie, because there was not even one single actor who acted a bit off. Everything in this movie, was simply, perfect.Hence, Simply Brilliant."
10/10,What a movie,ananoo,10/10/2019,What a movie
10/10,Good Performance and Story!!,bagierhacker,10/10/2019,I can tell Joaquin Phoenix doesn't looked like he is acting in the movie but he already dominates the role of the Joker himself and that is why he is an Oscar-Worthy. And actually the storyline is a little bit slow but it's very perfect.Great job!!
10/10,Masterpiece,rahulmangal-205-716265,10/10/2019,"This is an absolute must watch, it's a dark movie about the injustices of society"
10/10,Disturbingly Beautiful,agentsonar-3753,10/10/2019,"This film lives up to the hype. It was superbly crafted and I can smell the Oscar nominations already. I will also say it was probably one of the most psychologically disturbing films I've ever seen and I'm not in any hurry to see it again any time soon.But do yourself a favour, see it on the big screen, it'll add to the intensity."
10/10,1 word: AMAZING,japiekessels,10/10/2019,"Favorite movie of the century for me, joaquin phoenix's performance is fenomenal and is definitely one to remember."
10/10,"Something Fresh, Something New!",bdsamosky,10/10/2019,"This movie is amazing. Great acting that is so good, it gets under your skin. The psychological aspects keep you wondering what you are watching as you come to realize who this person is and why they see the world that they do!"
10/10,What an art,vaishnavcyem,10/10/2019,"Awesome movie ever watched bgm, visuals, performances just woow... Joaquin phoenix lived on the screen the story hatts off to tod phillips,I think an oscar is waiting for the work"
10/10,This was mind blowing!,priibe,10/9/2019,"I have second thoughts before watching that movie. But after seeing that, absolutely amazing!I'm sure Heath Ledger will give thumbs up in the sky!And the actor should get an Oscar 100%!!I recommend to watch you wont regret!"

10/10,Amazing!,sarimranova,10/9/2019,This is the best movie ever ! The Joker movie does touch on many psychological issues. In many of his words there is indeed the truth that lurks in this world
10/10,Joker is best 😍,iansteven,10/9/2019,"One of the best films I have ever seen, I had to go and see it twice"
10/10,Movie was so good and twisted I had to review it,dcw7091,10/8/2019,"Joker really is a movie you should think about watching before you actually do see it. It's twisted, demented and true to art imitating life. I squirmed many times due to how close to reality it was. Never expected a movie about a villain to be excruciatingly beautiful. It definitely isn't for everyone and that's fine. Joaquin Phoenix did Joker justice to the point where I was happy to how he came to be."
10/10,Absolutely incredible!!,lucyeyretanner,10/8/2019,Wow. Just wow. This film has blown me away! An absolute must see... one of the best films I have ever seen! It just gets better and better. A true masterpiece.
10/10,amazing movie,franciscasalinasro,10/7/2019,"I often go to see superhero or villian movies. But today I went to see the joker thinking that was the typical movie with a sad villain with family problems and stuff like that, but no, I GOT AMAZED it was spectacular, the acting of Phoenix got me disturbed it was incredible worth an Oscar and the movie itself was unbelievable, I couldn't stare away from the screen , I never knew what was going to happened and it kept me nervous an exited. 10/10"
10/10,Already a timeless classic...,danielnunez-81518,10/7/2019,"The comparisons to Taxi Driver are more than accurate and reminds you of other loner-vigilante style noir movies (Drive), but make no mistake, this has it's own mystique. Other people have already (and will continue) to explain why this movie is already a timeless classic. The themes explored here are ubiquitous in decades of character study cinema, but it never feels dull in this movie, it feels like a mind-stimulating food-for-thought.This movie made me FEEL, it made it's presence FELT. There was palpable tension in the theater, we knew we were witnessing something truly grandiose, but restrained enough to not push the pretentious border. It's a shame that this movie might have a stigma around it due to hyperbolic hysteria by headline/attention-seeking critics because there are far more violent films out there than this, this just happened to call out society and make the creators of a psychopath feel culpable, the truth hurts. This movie tells the truth.Joaquin Phoenix is a master at playing the brooding/unhinged role.If you watch movies for the purpose of wanting something to leave an impression on you, this is your movie. It does that in spades, and is one that welcomes repeat viewing.My movie of the year for 2019. Don't think another will come close. The House That Jack Built was my movie of the year for 2018, so I guess you can say I have a certain taste :)"
10/10,DO NOT MISS OUT ON THIS AMAZING MOVIE!!,alonxavt,10/7/2019,"One of the greatest comic-book villain movies in years! This movie blew my mind away when I watched it and there was so much explaining necessary to actually figure out what the Joker's whole story is about in this movie! I even rewatched the movie to get an even better understanding to what's going on! What an amazing movie! But let's get to the aspects of the movie. The story is absolutely unique, being taken in a more realistic approach! He doesn't get dipped in acid and turn insane, instead its from real life factors that turn him insane! The joker already has a mental illness in the first place too and how the story sets off from there is truly shocking and disturbing! There is so much to this story to explain, even you can come up with many theories on joker's life! It's truly depressing but terrifying at the same time! Then the acting with the characters. Joaquin Phoenix did so good in playing the Joker that he deserves to win an Oscar for it! I would be shocked if he doesn't win an Oscar at all because his acting was spot on to disturb us and shock us! All the other actors/actresses that were left did great in their acting of their characters, with many giving a realistic reaction to the joker! Then the style of the movie. The movie did so well in not overusing dramatization and truly offered a great dark theme throughout the Joker movie! As much as I have to say, this movie is one of the greatest movies this year and its truly the greatest villain origin movie I've ever watched! Definite recommend for everyone to watch!"
10/10,Much needed masterpiece,stefstars,10/7/2019,"Wow ! I'll be honest that I did not expect this one to live up to the hype, but it did. We've been overdue on having a proper masterpiece film out there and this one delivers. A movie that causes you to think and still leaves you thinking about why those events happened in the film or even real life. Leaves you thinking about why it's important to know both sides of a situation - of course this is a lesson that the Batman lore has always had, hence the villains having interesting backstories. There's so much to take in with this film, did you ever expect that from a comic book movie ? Much less a DC film ?! Batman has always been (to me at least) the most interesting story in the comic book world, because the villains are as interesting (if not more) than the hero. So many film adaptations have been made, but this one finally does an outstanding job exploring the story's most complex character. Joaquin Phoenix deserves all the praise for his take on this character. He got the mannerisms, looks, and ticks of a mentally unstable person down to a T, it's so natural and not cheesily forced - the guy is phenomenal. Whether people like it or not, we needed this film. No matter if you're part of the overly sensitive brigade that censors everything or an online edgelord who mocked this film for critiquing sOciEty, you need to watch this film - there's a valuable lesson in it for both of you. This is one of the greatest films that has come out in this decade. Congrats to the whole team who made it possible, outstanding job !"
10/10,Joker is the best villain ever and Joaquin shows that,giorgibregvadze,10/7/2019,"No superpowers, buf still the best villain ever. Just best performance, outstanding. This movie shows another reason why We love the joker"
10/10,OSCAR OSCAR OSCAR,mjoody-10210,10/7/2019,Just give Joaquin Phoenix he's Oscar and end the year
10/10,Best DC movie,jconstantinou-16334,10/6/2019,"Dark, gritty and raw, a spit and saw dust film that delivers a meaningful and compelling story, no CGI nonsense needed. Great character building, great production, they got the mood and character of Gotham spot on was bould and unapologetic which I really liked."
10/10,Nicholson + Ledger = Phoenix,mystycalfantasy,10/6/2019,"Beautiful picture, tremendous story telling, enormous acting, and amazing directing. Everything about this film is perfect!"
10/10,Just watch the movie,domitdiego,10/6/2019,"Remarkable movie, best thriller of all time. Scary to think people who really are crazy will watch."
10/10,Madness,barbarija,10/5/2019,"Resuming this movie: A guide do madness. The buildup is amazing, from a tender guy with a mind illness to Joker. Reminds a Nolan movie mixed with Scorsese, the atecipation was high and didn't disappoint. Great performance from Phoenix who surely deserves all the prizes he will get."
10/10,Joker is awesome! 1000/10 Oscar Worthy,nickweezy,10/4/2019,"Joker is awesome. The movie is more about Arthur Fleck dealing with mental illness rather than being Joker, but the movie is awesome! Amazing acting. This movie deserves an Oscar for its amazing performance. Joaquins acting was the best acting I've ever seen. This movie is 1000/10."
10/10,Great movie,851222,10/3/2019,"Greetings from Lithuania.I will be honest - i did not expected ""Joker"" (2019) to be this amazing movie. I saw trailer, i liked it, then read that it is heavily influenced on ""Taxi Driver"" and ""King of Comedy"" and thought that its going to be at least an interesting and not by a numbers comic book movie. And i was right - its far from any comic book movie i have seen ever, except for ""Logan"" and ""Dark Knight"". Well, know there is a ""Joker"". What made those two films exceptional? Its that they went beyond and in different direction then you conventional PG13 comic book flicks from Marvel. ""Joker"" on the other hand is a great character study movie - first thing. If you would remove Gotham city and some characters from Batman universe, this film wouldn't even had anything to do with comic book movies. The other thing is that its just superbly done - this is hands down best movie Todd Phillips has ever made (and i loved first ""Hangover""). Cinematography was gorgeous and very stylish, music was haunting and editing was top notch - this film at its running time 2 h run like wind for me. Oh ye, and then there is the best performance of the year (so far) by Joaquin Phoenix - his Joker i think stands on the same ground with a legendary performance by Heath Ledger - its that amazing, and a bit even more complex because in Dark Knight Joker was a side character - in here he is a central figure, and what a great character that was.Overall, ""Joker"" is a great character study movie, and a very unique comic book film. Its different, for sure and make no mistake its great not because its different - its because the bold direction creators have went with it and delivered it full. This is one of the very best films this year so far."
10/10,"Dark, Miserable, and Chaos, but... Beautiful",charlottenber,10/3/2019,"This Joker is darker than Dark Knight's Joker, The most miserable Joker than any other Joker, And most chaos Godam City ever. But it is most beautiful than any other Joker. Lastly, I can say, ""This Movie is Perfect"""
10/10,I relate to the joker,sethaaron-21078,9/1/2019,This movie is an absolute master piece. I have always related myself to the Joker and this movie mirrors how I feel on a day-to-day basis. This movie could not have been made any better. 10/10 Why s0 s3r10s? we really do live in a society.
1/10,Worst movie I have ever seen,timwackrow,10/25/2019,"I feel like the only person who thought this movie was absolutely terrible and a complete waste of time and money.Firstly it's in no way entertaining. Every scene is an endless indulgence of people trying to be artsy but only accomplishing a boring, frustrating and pointless video of an actor being totally mental. Being completely mental is not hard to script or act, nothing needs to make sense and you don't need any element of normality - enter the joker. Acting on the spectrum is much more difficult - think Forrest Gump, I am Sam or Rain Man.So if it's not meant to be entertaining than what's the point? Just to make you uncomfortable and frustrated? Job done. But who wants to watch that? No thanks.As far as being the joker that's the most disappointing aspect of the film. The character has 0 intelligence, manipulative inclinations or ability to scheme and organise (again he's completely insane). He's also not funny. The joker from the comics is the antithesis of batman. He has no back story, he's clever and cunning and always putting things together. He runs a criminal empire and never acts alone. This joker was a loner, totally insane and gets in a fridge? Also he's far too old to be the joker, when Bruce grows up he'll be fighting an old man. So if it's not a joker origin story then what is it? A poorly scripted, weak story with an agenda to showcase an unrealistic perspective on mental illness.The story moves along at a snail's pace to make allowances for the joker to dance around looking like a fruit cake. The whole movie is uncomfortable and low resolution in its plot and motive. If this is what passes as a good movie then it's a very sad day for humanity 1/10"
5/10,Not the Real Joker,hjvp_2806,10/22/2019,Not the Real Joker
1/10,I feel like everyone is brain washed,codysgriffit,11/23/2019,"I thought this movie was complete and utter garbage. I don't understand why people liked this movie so much. The character doesn't even stay true to the comics and the director flat out said it didn't, and then they made it seem like it was part of Gothams fall and he was just a little boy that had a laughing problem... Hated it"
10/10,Film of the year (if not of the decade),davidec23,11/18/2019,"I heard all the hype about this film and as a skeptic at heart I came into this film with the most critical mindset possible.I just finished watching it and I am absolutely speechless. I don't think a film such as this has ever been made in Hollywood before. The slow and steady fall of the Joker into complete insanity is just so realistic that you feel a strange empathy towards him and almost come to justify his actions even when he commits the most heinous crimes. This is what makes this film so incredible, it takes the ""villain/good guy"" type of film making and just flips it right on its head.The cinematography captures this perfectly, you never feel rushed into a scene and yet it keeps you glued to your seat (thanks also to the music and score which contour this film perfectly).Joaquin Phoenix gives the performance of the century and only thanks to his brilliance is this film even possible. I feel sorry for the actors who gave Oscar-worthy performances this year, as Mr. Phoenix's acting in this film is just from another planet and deserves all the accolades it can get."
1/10,Walked out half way thru the movie...,shiva_b,11/15/2019,Walked out half way thru the movie...
10/10,Brilliant,kevinparker100,10/26/2019,"Simply awesome.By no means a super hero or super villain type of movie. This chronicles one mans decent into insanity. It is grim, relentless, sad and utterly compelling. A damming indictment on how mental health issues are dealt with. Dismissed, mocked or simply ignored.In this story we are shown what happens when such an individual, finally, screams enough is enough. Down trotten, rejected by society and held up to endless ridicule, the Joker when he finally emerges is simply terrifying. His very public outing will go down in cinema history as it is memorising, disturbing and truly believable.There is talk of Oscars for this performance and it is absolutely merited, Joaquin Phoenix simply nailed this part. This is not a popcorn, switch off the brain and watch the action movie. It takes the viewer into the darkest, most distressing thing there is, our own mind.Brilliant movie."
10/10,What a remarkable insight into those who suffer from mental illness.,lil_miss_nessy,10/25/2019,"This movie was sensational.The actors, the cinematography and most importantly the insight into mental illness and it's victims.There is such a stigma towards mental illness and watching this movie really highlights some of the reasons that an individual may develop a mental illness, and how someone's childhood and upbringing can effect mental health throughout there entire life.The joker had serious trauma throughout his childhood, and it came to surface in adult hood as you can see in the movie.The build up of the movie from start to finish was very intense and overwhelming.It highlights the stigma people can have towards mental illness and should be an eye opener for those who are too quick to judge people.Sensational movie. I would recommend this to anybody. Huge thumbs up."
10/10,Unbelievably Perfect,forsythdenton-16796,10/25/2019,"I've never wrote a review, I regret every rating I've ever given a movie because of the tens I've put that pale in comparison to this masterpiece. What an amazing flick. Words can not describe the brilliance of Phoenix. Masterful. Mesmerizing."
10/10,A harsh and emotional masterpiece,edzuszvejnieks,10/24/2019,I just watched the Joker and it was so powerfull and its one of the only movies that makes you think about our society and our actions. Its such a masterpiece. A true work of art.
10/10,Masterpiece with one flaw,Isaiahs_B,10/24/2019,Probably one of the best movies I have ever seen in a while. The one flaw it has was probably that it could of made the lines of what was a dream the whole time and what was reality smoother.
10/10,This movie is no Joke,jct-40618,10/24/2019,"Thinking to Joker it is a haunting, beautiful film that shines in it's brutality. Not in terms of the violence, but more along the lines of witnessing one man's journey into madness. Each event, each action provides a great amount of weight along with an unease factor.Joaquin Phoenix's performance was phenomenal and you can feel the heartbreak along with the mental strain that continously pushes him into a dark mind set.The grittier nature of Gotham, combined with the beautiful score really help sets the mood, and the songs from Frank Sinatra and Jimmy Durante adds whole another of class in midst of the slums. The Cinematography manages to catches the beauty, and the despair of a Gotham city that is falling apart, not too mention that the score and licensed songs help add another layer to the film."
10/10,Snoby critics get over yourselves,gazzolaaria,10/23/2019,"NO SPOILERSGreat movie. Tasteful references to 'The King of comedy'. Somewhat in line with the Batman story line. Cinematography, acting, story, character progression, comedic tones... All perfect.A good watch, highly recommended it. I don't know who is paying these critics to write such BS reviews. You're not original when you rate a good movie badly. We all know you are just doing it for attention/clicks/fame. Yours is a dying breed and the more pointless reviews you write the less we will care about you. Grow up."
10/10,10 stars closest to perfection ever,dalpendre,10/23/2019,"Saw the movie yesterday. Amazing. It's a captivating story and also tragic. Joaquin acting is superb, and so is the whole cast. I rarely want to see a movie tive um the cinema, but I think I will make an exception on this one."
10/10,Joaquin is fanatic,yuvrajfulwariya,10/23/2019,I'm just gonna say wait for the 2nd half.Its a masterpiece.
10/10,For those who gave out score under 10,kl-47246,10/17/2019,"This is not a normal superhero movie where you will expect glamorous CG. But it definitely gives you more thrill and excitement than the other superhero movie. A smile, a bully, a setback, a betray, a misunderstanding, a confusion, a lie, a chance, these are what life makes of. Anyone who gave out score lower than 9 repeatedly reported the lack of excitement from the movie, that's because you guys are lack of life experience to feel so."
10/10,Unbelievably perfect,Police21786,10/16/2019,"Very rarely now it seems does a movie even leave you feeling like it was a worthwhile investment of your time. More often now films are regurgitated storylines, reboots, or an attempt at something new that feels like it shouldn't have been done. Even more rare now is a movie that leaves an impact on you long after you see it. Joker is just that.Granted there is a lot of hype with this movie and an equal number of ""professional"" critics who clearly think it's cooler for them to say this is a terrible movie so that it makes them feel elite over the common moviegoers. With that said, this movie is absolutely perfect and how anyone cannot say that after seeing it clearly doesn't have what it takes to appreciate such raw talent of acting, writing, direction, cinematography, and music.The entire film feels so intentionally and intensely dark, awkward and real that it make you feel the sanity slipping from Arthur's grasp. Phoenix's acting challenges that of even Ledger's Joker and does so through mastering the smallest physical gestures and expressions that make the character feel more real than ever. From the way he runs, dances, stares and smiles it feels 100% authentically Joker.The movie does a great job incorporating elements of the Batman series that fans will enjoy but makes this a completely stand alone movie. For anyone worried that they might not get it because they don't follow Batman, no worries, you won't be disappointed. The storyline does a fantastic job of ""producing"" the Joker, giving him slow building reason behind the madness that feel authentic rather than corny. The incorporation of Pseudobulbar Affect disorder, and even the way it's initially presented and the character's ongoing struggle with it throughout, to explain for and add the maniacal laughter is genius. The childhood trama mixed with current personal and social issues with a desire to fit in makes for compelling reasons to believe this is happening rather than a supervillain being born from being picked on.The entire movie is dark. And that's an understatement. Like Requiem for a Dream level dark. And the story feels like Taxi Driver, V for Vendetta, and American Psycho crammed together inside a Dark Knight costume. All of this is done completely right in every aspect from lighting and angles, to interesting intermittent scenes to add more to the development of the story and character, to perfect camera angles, shots and editing, to intense and properly chosen music. I guess my only criticism is the casting of De Niro. Let's face it, he's not a good actor and we're all just kinda going along with him because he's ""one of the greats"". Earlier in his career and in some roles sure. But not now and not as a funny late night talk show host. But... it's not terrible and they make it work but better casting could have been done rather than relying on a big name.This movie is one that will go down for me as one of the best I've ever seen. I left the theater wanting to buy another ticket and go back in to make the experience last. Very few movies now make you feel something. Even fewer do it this well."
10/10,A masterpiece,guytenn,10/15/2019,"This is one of those once in a lifetime movies that will make you move uncomfortably in your seat. You want to chear for him, you understand how he got to where he is, but your logic and morals don't let you connect. Truly a masterpiece, and fantastic acting. Life is cruel, people are cruel, and this movie slaps you in the face with it."
10/10,Go watch it with an open mind,labbeatsdre,10/14/2019,"I personally loved the movie, you have to go in with an open mind. I agree that you can't compare Heath's Joker to Joaquin's. They're both unique and spectacular in their own way"
10/10,People Severely Missunderstand What This Movie Is About,vpopescu-59116,10/14/2019,"Joker is a film about a man's transformation from the mentally ill loner Arthur Fleck to the widely-known villain Joker. This seems straightforward enough, but there are much deeper messages in this movie that apply not just to this fictional universe, but to our real world.Arthur is a man who has been beaten down by not just society but fate itself time and time again. He has been dealt, for lack of a better term, a s*** hand and no one in his life seems to truly want to help him. He is a man that truly is alone in society, learning throughout the film how true that statement really is.While the actions committed by him are definitely wrong, we understand him and can even somewhat empathize with him (hopefully we can, I may just be weird). Unlike how some people like to suggest, this movie doesn't glorify the violence that Arthur causes. This movie shows how horrible people can be created by the environment they are living in. We are living in a time where we like to blame the violence around us on the insane people who start it. Shootings are happening more than ever, and the insane gunman is responsible for it.Of course, it cannot be denied that the gunman is at fault. There is clearly something wrong with the people who do these things. However, much too few people think, ""Why is this happening?"", ""Why are these people doing the things they do, and how can we stop them from doing this?"" We see the result of what happens when an at risk individual doesn't get the help he needs in this movie. What we need is a system that can actually help these people.The movie Joker differs from other comic book movies because it is not only grounded in reality, but it's messages can be directly applied to our world. People like Arthur Fleck, people who have been brutally beaten by life at every turn need a way to be helped. The rich and successful don't care about these people. These people are viewed as threats instead of who they really are: humans, just like everyone else. We need to create an outlet where these individuals can get the actual support they need, not stuff them with medication and let specialists with their own agendas pretend to care about them.Another argument I've seen about this movie is that it has no reason for existing. It shows violence and shows a unique portrayal of a popular character but it has no substance to it. As you can probably tell, I strongly disagree with anyone who believes this, and I truly believe anyone who thinks this completely missed the point of the entire movie.In conclusion, this movie definitely has substance and doesn't glorify violence in the slightest. This movie brings up an issue in our society that we have been neglecting for far too long. There's a stigma about mentally ill people that we have to get over. People who have been neglected and have nothing left to lose are the most dangerous type of people, and the problem with our society is that we allow people to feel as if they have nothing left to lose. Arthur Fleck is just a person who never got any sign at all that he was needed or loved by society, or anyone for that matter. He is truly, as cliche as this may sound, a product of his environment. You can criticize this movie for being too dark but by doing so you're just dismissing the reality we live in."
10/10,Best Joker Origin Movie,Ring_of_Sun,10/13/2019,"Amazing Acting , plot , directing everything is perfect .one of the best joker origin movie"
10/10,Make me feel like I am in this movie,vanchaqepps,10/13/2019,"Love how Phoenix express himself as Joker, absolutely will watch this movie again."
10/10,Outstanding,chrismorgan-67871,10/13/2019,"I made an IMDb account just to write a review for this film and give it the 10 star rating it deserves. JP plays the role of Joker perfectly. Dark, disturbed, lonely, angry, he just nails every aspect and his performance in this film just has to be seen. He 100% has to win the best actor Oscar when awards season arrives. I was hooked from the very first scene and was enthralled throughout. What an outstanding piece of cinema. Amazing. The best film I have seen in a long, long time."
10/10,Perfection.,thomaskrian,10/13/2019,"Watching this film was fantastic, you were so immersed in it and everything that happend had some real impact, to some even, relatable problems. The music was fantastic, the atmosphere was good and the way Arthur tries to be positive and find solace and happiness, everything is only made worse by lies, no help, no friends no nothing.The reason for why for me it is a 10/10 is because i've been in a similar situation before, no friends, don't know how to get help or what to do. Sometimes these simple problems cause the worst of epidemics, ex: violence, mass shootings, suicides and so on.This movie is pretty much a fantastic depiction of mental illness and ""society"".Watch it, it'll open your eyes to alot of things and topics you've never been able to grasp in its entirety."
10/10,Best of all time...,patildharmesh,10/13/2019,Full of emotions and performance of actor is world class definitely Oscar getting movie
10/10,Best of the best,neblinaz-438-587135,10/13/2019,"An.outstanding performance from Joaquin Phoenix, serious masterpiece, a beautiful soundtrack, quality scenes. The best movie of the year and one of the bests of all time"
10/10,Salute to the Joker!!,ritesh_sahay-24036,10/13/2019,"Dazzling performance, every moment shown can be happening to so many of us. Nerve breaking acting. This movie will remain one of my favorite for ever. Everyone needs some importance in life. Thank you for making it so real."
10/10,"What do you get when you cross a brilliant actor, a meaningful movie and the best supervillain in comics?",Hekaru,10/13/2019,"The feelings that this movie brings on you are really hard to describe, and it takes a while to swallow completely. Its dark and enters in morality and realistic topics, criticizing the way that society works, how most people see the mental illness and how an economic crisis can afect someone. Joker isn't a monster without feelings, he is a creation of a broken world, a broken Gotham City.The most amazing part of the film is that they put you in the mind of Arthur Fleck, in a lot of scenes which there is a conflict between Humor, Tension and Fear. Out of nowhere you find yourself and others laughing at a terrible scene, just like the Joker would, and there is nothing you can do about it.The development of the protagonist is well distributed and it works. His laughs which were once impulsive and uncontrolled turns into a coordenated and at the same time chaotic aspect of the personality of Arthur. I really think that Joaquin Phoenix did an excellent job and deserve at least an indication to the Oscars, being pessimistic.And answering the title of the review:I tell you what you get, you get the best movie of comics ever made!"
10/10,Best Movie in 2019,oomsiti,10/13/2019,Outstanding movie with a haunting performance and best character development ever seen
10/10,Flawless masterpiece!!,moayyadakl,10/13/2019,This is one of the best movies ever. What a great performance by Joaquin Phoenix (Oscar winner) Todd Philips is genius (Oscar winner). Everything about this movie is just perfect.
10/10,Definitely worth seeing,taylorbomer,10/13/2019,"Not only was this movie a masterpiece, but Joaquin Phoenix's acting is PHENOMENAL! Hands down the best movie on the year. Very dark and beautiful. Explosive and exciting."

10/10,Unreal,ammonhallsted,10/13/2019,"It's the best movie I've seen, at least in the last decade. It's the easily conceivable story of a man who has been abandoned by the system that is supposed to protect us from people like him."
10/10,Definitely recommend,dakotahlandry,10/13/2019,Great movie. It is is the mind of a person with a mental illness.
10/10,WORDS CANNOT DESCRIBE THIS MOVIE,meemoahmed,10/13/2019,"Where do I start with this.... the storyline, the acting, it was just incredible. Hats off to Todd Philips, he made all of us viewers jokers as well, cuz whenever he would do something that isn't right, we would get happy and laugh with him. This is one of its kind!!"
10/10,The start of something very special indeed...,suruk-04505,10/12/2019,Possibly the best comic book character depiction ever put into film. You feel the transition coming through every scene in the film and the wait is amazingly worth it when the joker finally arrives. The scene on the steps when he's become the joker was spine tingling because you realise this really is the Joker that your watching in the flesh. If this is the only version of Phoenix as the joker I'll have to accept it but if they can replicate this quality into a sequel it will be spectacular. What a film!
10/10,For the first time ever I will be returning to cinema to watch this again,delbomber-64048,10/12/2019,"I admit it. I did not expect much from this film. But my god It was a nice surprise! Positives is by far the transformation of joker from start of the film to the end. It's incredibly dark and probably too distressing for some people to watch. The violence happens now and then but each time makes a huge impact! The negatives are obvious the main one being of course the late heath ledger, he left quite a high bar to jump! I personally believe phoenix matches him and does jump that bar. People just need to realise this is a different actors approach and different take on a character from a different universe. The second negative is the one that got to me the most. I personally believe part of jokers charm is no one has a clue who he is where he's come from or how he got them scars. I did eventually accept the origin story of course and I ask other hardcore comic book fans to do the same. As once you pass this hurdle this does become one of the best films ever. I will be returning to the cinema to watch this again which Is a first for me."
10/10,A Masterpiece,stacybelu,10/12/2019,"From the moment I watched the trailer I was intrigued by the portrayal of this Joker. I loved that they created a backstory for this villain, it made him human. Joaquin Phoenix was amazing, his performance throughout was astonishing, from contorting his body, to dancing, his glance very strong. I also loved the choice of his outfit (and colours) when dancing down the stairs, just perfect. The music, journal writings and silences were powerful. I cannot remember the last time I admired a movie this much."
10/10,Amazing movie,bo-naerr,10/12/2019,10/10 it is unfair for this movie because he deserve moreSpecial thanks for all the crew in the movie
10/10,What a Performance,aboche,10/12/2019,JP is so good that it hurts watching this stellar Performance. I grew up reading DC and Batman in particular... this movie leaves me speechless and this Joker Origin is just perfect. I will cry myself to sleep tonight...
10/10,That's Life!,hannestwersen,10/12/2019,That's Life!
10/10,Simply brilliant,alexiamaria,10/12/2019,"I would like to start this review by pointing out the fact that everything in this movie is just amazing, from the cast & crew members to the acting and to the story itself. Many people believed that this would just be another Marvel-like movie, but it was nothing like that. Todd did an excellent job in telling this character's story in such a unique way that it makes you want more. The way that he told the story of this worldwide known character is something amazing. The cinematography itself was simply astonishing. Troughout the movie there were some amazing shots that just took your breath away.Joaquin's acting in this picture was just out of this world. The way that he portraied Joker's character was something to learn from. He put his whole heart in this particular role and you could easily see it while watching the movie. He made you fall in love with the character, although he is a villain. Even the dancing scenes took my breath away as he did such an amazing job in this area too. He truly deserves an Oscar for this outstanding performance.I truly believe that this is one of the best character studies there ever were. It is one of those movies that make you want to see it again and again without getting bored of it. It makes you want more. Todd made such a good job by bringing awareness to mental health issuesto the world and although this movie has its range of bad reviews, it still makes you understand how the society truly works these days.To conclude, this is and exceptional movie and i totally recommend it with all my heart. You will not regret it!"
10/10,"Well-crafted, tragic, and dark work of art",elian_massoud,10/12/2019,"This is one of the movies that you watch and end up thinking about for a while after.It's very rare that a movie makes you truly terrified and yet understanding of why this villain is the way he is.The acting is absolutely incredible, hats off to Joaqin Phoenix for this legendary performance.The soundtrack was haunting, eerie, and heavy. Hildur Guðnadóttir's choice of using cello as the main instrument allowed for a very dark and churning sound that perfectly captures the turmoil inside of Arthur. Bravo!The cinematography is breathtaking, the visuals are stunning, and combined with the meticulous directing and attention to detail, the final product ends up being a true masterpiece."
10/10,The best Joker origin film.. ABSOLUTE MASTERPIECE,mahendran61997,10/12/2019,"A well crafted film with a more realistic approach on the comic book villain joker. The movie takes everyone to the 80's environment with the amazing cinematography, costumes and set design. Joaquin Phoenix is the only actor who could perform this iteration of Joker to the perfection. The movie is great and will be a cult film because it took a realistic approach by showcasing who Arthur Fleck is, and what makes him to be the joker. There aren't many action scene which is a great choice and in the few fight scenes which the movie has depicts how vulnerable is Arthur. The Nolan's Trilogy was a huge success and loved among the fans till date because it had a similar approach by making a batman film in a more realistic and a believable tone by making him more vulnerable to punches, guns, knives, dogs[;)] instead of making him more pumped up with too many gadgets, armor and fighting against the unbelievably strong godlike villains with his infinite stamina, health and never ending supply of his gadgets. The more grounded approach made the audience feel connected with Nolan's Trilogy. This film also follows in those footsteps and had achieved it perfectly. Todd Phillips with his direction and Joaquin Phoenix with his acting, together they have crafted a masterpiece."
10/10,Over the top!,hathanajc,10/12/2019,"People are already familiar with superhero movie genres (like MCU) - state-of-the-art special effects, top-notch action, eye-catching action, clear good and evil, usually divided into two lines of good and bad characters fight with each other. Joker appears as a new breeze, the film with dark colors, heavy psychology, multiple meanings. The film also has a villain, but it seems that besides Joker, all the remaining characters are villains, he alone with his desire, with his soul and body have been trampled to the extreme against whole ""world"". The majority of moviegoers are young people, including those who once loved the Joker of The Dark Knight. The Joker in TDK is much more crazy from thinking to acting out through action. He lives for his IDEAL, making Harley Quinn crazy with him. Joaquin's Joker is also crazy but crazy in a more life-like manner, with more psychological changes, making the audience think more. And so among the heads who have seen Endgame, there are some who have not felt the Joker, have not been familiar with such a heavy psychological drama after days of watching and waiting for the super products blockbusters, romance movies, live - action movies and horror movies. And although I disagree with Martin Scorsese's opinion that ""Marvel movies are not movies"", I understand he has his reasons for saying so. Please review Joker a few more times to feel the full meaning of the movie, I myself could not understand all the messages that the film sent, so I will definitely have to watch it again. I am waiting for analyzing and explaining the cut scenes in Vietnam. But please don't say that Joker is ""bored"", ""sleepy"", ""not as good as Joker in TDK"", ... something like that. Because it's not natural that Joker is so appreciated. 😉"
4/10,Disturbed movie with few highligts,lukas_dolinsky,10/12/2019,"In my opinion this movie is too disturbed.The character of ""Joker"" is a sick person that loves to kill other people but that's not who Joker should be.So in general, there are good parts in the movie but in total I'm disappointed by it!"
10/10,A movie not made for all,carlo-oclarit,10/12/2019,"Ive been lucky to live and witness both Heath's and Joaquin's performance and till now the feeling is still surreal.It started with a slow pace, detail by detail describing how Joker became. Story telling was superb as it covered every aspect of the film. In short every question was answered from the start till the finish.I tell you this movie is not made for all. It is very dark and it will leave a mark on you when you finished it watching. An instant classic for me!"

10/10,A Study of Mental Illness,zeuthuk,10/11/2019,"The Joker is basically a film about a man dealing with severe mental illness. You will watch him go about his daily life struggling to cope and deal with the world around him. You will see how his illness affects him, it's quite unsettling.The Joker is dark and depressing throughout. It's an Oscar winning performance by Joaquin phoenix.This film is about the Joker before he becomes the Joker. It's his struggle with mental illness while he is trying to find his place in the world and become the comic book character that takes on Gotham City. I don't think most people quite realise this before they go to see it."

I would without a doubt argue that Joaquin Phoenix holds one of the best performances of all time, this may even be the best performance I've ever witnessed in cinema. Truly truly a masterwork. People say it's violent but the world is violent, just most people who can afford to go to the movies are lucky enough that their bubble keeps the darker parts of the world out, but how long can we stay at such peace?

This is a type of movie which comes once in every 50 years, it's a pure art depiction of how a mentally ill person lives and finds it's true self. For those who don't know this movie is not taken from the comics nor it is related to the Justice League universe. This is a fresh take on the Joker character."

This film will be the topic of many a discussion for years to come Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerising and equally the most disturbed Joker I have watched. Hoorah at last for something that's truly changed my opinion on modern film choices. But a huge congrats to those brave enough to endeavour in rebelling in film making in a world gone politically mad."

10/10,Future cult movie.,eduardobranas,10/9/2019,"'Joker' is raw, real. It does not seek to impress but it does, and in what way. Todd Phillips manages to give a new air to the genre of superheroes, and Joaquin Phoenix is sublime in his performance... Not only does he understand the complicated character but he makes it his own. Something very dificult considering the iconic performances of Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger."
10/10,Hauntingly Beautiful,dahl_green,10/6/2019,"Personally I was not ready for the intensity and the realistic nature of Jokers mental health. This version of Joker stands on its own and should not be compared to DC or Marvel. It's a Drama. I have never had a ""Comic Book"" movie give way to all the emotions I felt, questioning every part of humanity and how we treat each other makes a difference. I applaud this movie for asking hard questions. Joaquin Phoenix was fantastic. It's a 10 stars in my book."

I travelled around 100 kms just to watch this movie. Because I just don't want to miss this one. And ofcourse I loved the movie. It's once in a lifetime movie. It is Dark, disturbing, intense. Yet undeniably a masterpiece. Joaquin Phoenix without any doubt is a real gem of the cinema. This one is not for people who like typical commercial movies and who don't like dark, intense and violent theme.Robert de Niro's role was short but he did a great job as expected. The movie keeps getting dark. I loved the pace, direction & cinematography. And the BGM is just fantabulous. From the moment when he puts a smile on his face with blood shows that Arthur Fleck is dead now and The Clown Prince of Crime is born. From that moment, He is no longer just a shadow, he's the light of those people to stand up against the oppressors of Gotham. Truly, I feel so overwhelmed by watching this movie. Loved it."

10/10,Unbelievably good.. so much better than I expected!,jdizzla89,10/6/2019,"I've just got back from the cinema and I'm still in complete shock how incredible this film is. The acting from Joaquin moved me in parts and felt uncomfortable but incredibly gripping at the same time, just amazing. I've never felt this way from any of the previous related films, but this one is very different. You truly feel empathy for Arthur even though he has none himself and this film not only helps to put the whole backstory into perspective in a way that's never been imagined before, but also truly unique and intense while retaining moments of dark humour even in some of the most depraved scenes. Absolute masterpiece!"
10/10,A chilling masterpiece,RedFoxVertigo,10/6/2019,"Joaquin Phoenix is utterly phenomenal portraying the birth of Gotham's greatest villain, the Joker.This is a story of man slowly losing faith in humanity to the point of madness. We get to know the Joker first as Arthur Fleck; a sad loner who isn't well liked because he makes people uncomfortable. He doesn't have friends, or a special someone in his life, only his mother who he still lives with and cares for. Arthur does the best that he can, working hard as a party clown but he is down on his luck and the world he lives in is brutal. On top of that his dream of becoming a comedian is shattered when talk show host Murray Franklin shows a clip of Arthur bombing at a comedy club. Meanwhile tension in Gotham has been mounting as the poor have been suffering and they turn their anger towards the rich, who seem completely indifferent to the struggles of those living in poverty. It's the perfect recipe for disaster and chaos.This haunting tale is definitely a must-see!"
10/10,Joker is vary good,ymlxhf,10/6/2019,"Joaquin Phoenix gives a tour de force performance, fearless and stunning in its emotional depth and physicality. It's impossible to talk about this without referencing Heath Ledger's Oscar-winning performance from The Dark Knight, widely considered the definitive live-action portrayal of the Joker, so let's talk about it. The fact is, everyone is going to be stunned by what Phoenix accomplishes, because it's what many thought impossible - a portrayal that matches and potentially exceeds that of The Dark Knight's Clown Prince of Crime"

10/10,Glorious interpretation,peppepar,10/6/2019,What an amazing interpretation by Phoenix!Also the plot is brilliant. Well done!
10/10,Performing this far is not easy. It's a masterpiece.,shivendrasharma,10/6/2019,"The fact that the film has the best giggle so classic of Joker's hysterical laugh makes this film deserving of an Oscar. It certainly is a masterpiece, far outperforming Dark Knight and actually deserving a place beside Taxi Driver."
10/10,Every movie should be this good,danielmols,10/6/2019,"In my opinion Joker is a flawless movie. The dedicated way Joaquin Phoenix portrays the character is so unique you just have to appreciate it. The character development throughout the movie is some of the best I've ever seen and the cinematography was absolutely stunning. I was hooked for the 2 hours the movie lasted. I think if you appreciate movies as a form of art you must think this is one of the best movies out there, if you're just looking for a superhero movie to watch then you probably won't like it that much."
10/10,Wow...just wow,raabrm,10/6/2019,"Probably the best, most compelling movie I've seen in a long time. Joaquin Phoenix is a LEGEND!!!"
10/10,Masterpiece..,thedarkgotham,10/6/2019,It's been a long time since Hollywood has put out a good film. This one will make you explore feelings you didn't want to and feel good about it. The story with Phoenix performance is historical. Every aspect of this was perfect. I can't believe how great this movie is.
10/10,"""Joker"" is the pinnacle of comic book film",drewcornman,10/5/2019,"Now that the Joker has had a couple of legitimate outings, I think it's clear to say that Joker may be that best outing. I know that Heath Ledger is known to have the best performance, but wow does Phoenix deserve an Oscar. His character goes through such a terrifying and disturbing character arc that you don't want to see, yet can't look away. All the performances are sensational (including a couple of twists) and a brilliant ending to wrap everything together. The score matches it clearly, taking that ""Joker"" persona very clearly. I can't think of anybody that can match what this character may be. If Phoenix wins an Oscar, then this means that the Joker is one of the most complex and interesting character ever in film. All in all, Joker makes the viewer believe that everything he does is okay (but it's clearly not) and keeps you on the edge of your seat through brilliant direction and a sensational character study."
10/10,Best movie of the year so far,jameswprice-43714,10/5/2019,"Phoenix gives an absolutely phenomenal performance as the joker, in my opinion the best that has ever been put to screen. The story goes places you would never expect it to and plays around with the Batman/Gotham city lore/characters in interesting ways.My only slight problem is that I think it takes a little too much inspiration from taxi driver, and that a certain character feels wasted or unimportant but they're not in it for that much anyway"

10/10,I want to smile and cry at the same time,ry1979,10/5/2019,"The title of my review is how I imagine the joker would want me to feel.I want to smile as the directing and acting is flawless. You believe every scene and quite frankly you would be an a****** to try and pick holes in it.The crying is how at the centre of it, Arthur actually has a good heart, but was screwed over by society, work and family. What you're left with is the result of someone who looks at life with a glass half full coming to the relation that life is actually a glass half empty."
10/10,Perfect in every way!! WOW 👏🏼👏🏼,justintruax,10/5/2019,"Not a huge Phoenix fan, or Phillips fan.. but wow did they ever work hard on this!

10/10,A perfect comic character based film - JOKER_2019,hemachandra-67983,10/4/2019,"***_NO_SPOILERS_***Finally a DC movie savagely walked n sat on the Masterpiece Shelve beside ""Dark Knight trilogy"". First I thought, It would have been great if Martin Scorsese directed this film when it was announced long back, but #Todd_phillips proved he is a master in carving this Art-Emotional-Crime-SuperVillain-Drama , a little slow.. but not for me , So Deep, Dark & Psychological tale for the origin of The JOKER , Todd Phillips's previous Comedy-dramas have gave him so much experience & insight to deal this psychic comedian, and he used it perfectly.Cinematography, lighting, Set works, Editing have perfectly delivered us Retro style of Gotham city.Joaquin Phoenix is the best JOKER till date as same as Heath ledger. But if I must say who is the 1st best... it's ""Phoenix"" of course for me, hands down !! Because he showed us shades of sanity to Insanity . A full length character study throughout the duration of the film.Robert De Niro , what to say about him ? , Top notch performance as Murray.that vintage stage-dramatic music is so engaging & apt to every scene accordingly.-Over all it is one of the greatest comic based films .Phoenix deserves best actor academy award.#NOTE : This film is not like other DC/Marvel comics based films , not even a bit, far less popcorn entertainer than ""dark Knight trilogy""... No money heists, no major chase sequences, no blasts & shootouts , no big action sequences, ...It's something like the this decade's Taxi driver (1976), The King of comedy (1982) & Man on the moon (1999). If you are only into that above entertainer kinda stuff & doesn't like little slow art type films, then better stay away from this ."

10/10,"An instant classic, with the best performance since Ledger's Joker. Also, it has the most impactful last 15 minutes of any movie ever.",fcruzgalea,10/4/2019,"I was on board for this movie since day one. When the first trailer came out I was shocked by how you could see the the care and detail in every shot of the movie. And, Phoenix's performance looked insane. After the final trailer I was sure this movie was going to become best movie of 2019. And, when I finally coud watch, all my expectations were fulfilled. From start to end this movie just cannot stop. You will laugh, you will get shocked, you will even cry. This is the best character study I have seen since Taxi Driver. Simply, magnificent. And that ending, well..."

1/10,Crap,clarkkent-38274,11/4/2019,It doesn't follow story at all and casting was terrible Joker would be 80 or dead before he even fights Batman and he looks like some crazy clown.
10/10,Awesome,trashgang,10/10/2019,"So this was well promoted on every social net you could think. So this was told to be the best flick of 2019, So many things were said and so I was afraid it was overhyped.Let me tell you, not one bit. First of all, happy to see Robert De Niro back in a flick that suits him. No more comedies please Robert. Secondly, the comparing all over the net between Ledger and Phoenix. They are both excellent in their own ways.The movie itself. Starts off rather as a normal flick, except for opening credits which took me back to the old WB logo's and yellow lettering of the seventies, but quickly turns into a dark movie getting darker and darker and more and more insane. The way it was shot, the score my God, really well done.And then there's the performance that couldn't beat Ledger. Well, Ledger I do still like as the Joker but what Phoenix did as the sart of the Joker is really really worth the Oscar. The skinny body, the laughter, the sick looks. with De Niro in it it did remind me of Taxi Driver who one person can turn from a desperate person into a mad person.Towards the end I was thinking, okay, so far 10 out of 10 but are they going to ruin the link towards Batman. They didn't, the last 15 minutes, man, it fits perfectly into the Batman world.It's been a while I have seen such a flick, and after some Marvel rather boring stuff (Avengers Endgame for example) again I was shown that DC is my thing.I can go on and on. The impossible mission to beat Ledger, well, the Oscars will proof that it has been done.Be warned, rated 16+, totally correct due the brutal action and the downward spiral of the storyGore 0/5Nudity 0/5Effects 0/5Story 5/5Comedy 0/5"
2/10,Jokes on us,anthonytj,10/9/2019,"Horribly shallow, derivative and repugnant. Dramatically flawed - actually the story of the mother told through the excruciatingly telescoped lens of the son. In the process it vilifies just about everyone (but no points for consistency because if they'd had the guts, a struggle with sexuality might have actually made it interesting {I can't help thinking the thought was on Joaquin's mind but the film declared otherwise}). One of the profound master strokes of Ledger's portrayal was to specifically preclude the need of an origin story yet like so many the need to have that incredible manifestation explained willed me to my seat for the whole acrid, eat-all-your-stinky-seventies-references-or-there's-no-dessert duration. What is eventually slopped out in response to the riddle of the joker (I promise to take that no further) however is so remarkably banal that it better serves to illuminate the gluttonous, exploitative villainy of the corporations behind the production. That said, production values were decent although I couldn't help comparing the dim cinematography to the exquisitely stark visions of the Nolan movies."
10/10,This is how DC movies should be made,daniimam,10/6/2019,"This movie blew me away. I was very hyped and excited for it, but I kept myself distant from the trailers and clips. Joaquin Phoenix is a now certified LEGENDARY actor!!! Jesus he was amazing in this movie, and delivers probably the greatest solo acting performance since heath ledger in the dark knight. I will admit the movie was a bit slow but I was easy to forgive since this is a character study kind of movie and it does say a lot about society. I won't go into deep specifics in this review but you'll know when you see it. I thought the cinematography was stunning of a run down Gotham City, the score was thrilling and mesmerizing. I can't get it out of my head, I just simply can't. I highly highly recommend this movie if you favor great acting and if you want your mind to be blown. Thank you for your time."
10/10,outstanding,alioraibi2002,9/1/2019,Very nice in my opinion it is the best story about the joker
10/10,Best movie of the year,BlueSkies765,11/20/2019,"I feel like a lot of movies that get hyped up are somewhat overrated. I didn't feel that way with the Joker. It exceeded my expectations. First of all what a decision to turn a comic book character into a serious drama. Turning a cartoonish villain into a vulnerable human. It's very creative and honestly for me this was the best movie of the year. You got so many comic book spinoffs that I have no interest in but this isn't even about a comic book it's a very human story.Joker is very dark. So dark that I won't watch it again in the near future. That means it did the job as it was meant to be a punch to the guts. Of course Joaquin Phoenix was excellent in this movie. His acting was phenomenal. He was able to make you feel so many different emotions. The screenplay was also excellent. It's a very human story that feel realistic.Joker is simply a masterpiece. Well-written, well-directed and well-acted. It's the best movie of the year and it's certainly a cult classic that will remain the topic of discussion for decades."
10/10,A work of art...,redhotcherry86,11/17/2019,"Outstanding performance by Phoenix, amazing character development... one of the best movies I have seen in a while..."
10/10,So that was...quit the expierience.,salduttinate,11/17/2019,"K this was an incredible work of art, not gonna beat around the bush. Jauquin pheonix is giving a career highlight here, it might be even better than his performance in the master but I'll have to think about that. Tod philips and cinematographer Laurence shaper have made a beautifully shot movie, and the shot length really gives pheonix and De Niro room to act. The camera work itself is also very well done, but its not the type off camera work that calls attention to itself like that of Paul Thomas Anderson or Martin Scorsese. The blending of reality and fantasy and reality is also extremely well handled, I'm not gonna give spoilers but I will say that its kind of like American psycho and middle school:the worst years of my life (does anybody's remember that book?). It is important to mention that this movie is not for everyone, it is violent and intense, but that being said its not as violent as other art house movies like drive or hereditary. No, its not really the violence as much as the intensity and the emotion that the film evokes, which is most certainly not a complaint its a great aspect of the film. Cinifix's 10 most emotional movie moments has 2 slots in it that focus on second hand embarrassment or cringe and deep uncofortable-ness and I'd say about 87 percent of the film are squarely in those 2 spaces. Overall this movie in its own special way is a masterpiece, even if its not at all easy to watch."

10/10,A real masterpiece,tpoirier,11/5/2019,Saw it yesterday and it is still replaying in my head. Loved every minute of it.The acting was phenomenal. In some scene Joaquin was conveying several emotions at the same time with total surrender and believability. I was just in awe to see a human do this. That's acting on master level. At the same time you saw this very fragile looking human being a victim of his illness and environment and on the other this incredibly strong will (insanity ?) shining through. The cinematography was just amazing. I was drawn into this dark depressing environment but with such a visual clarity and details. I almost forgot the music. There was this cello music emphasizing dark insanity coming out drawing you further into the scenes. And during the action scenes some very fitting songs were started in perfect synchrony. Great.One of the best movies I have ever seen. A real masterpiece.
10/10,Movie of the Year!,go_for_veer,10/31/2019,"It was pretty clear from before the movie got released that despite being a central comic book villain, Joker would not be anywhere along the lines of any superhero/super villain film we've ever seen. Instead of having the clown of Gotham going on a mad rampage to burn down the city, we witness an origin story for Joker : a story of how a normal if not slightly delusional person on being bogged down by society can turn into an uncontrollable, cold-blooded madman that we all know of.Joker's alter ego Arthur Fleck's struggles makes it immensely relatable and it is amazing to watch the character develop throughout the film. Joaquin Phoenix never fails, delivering a strong performance and proving that he is one of the best, most devoted method actors in the industry.Joker rides on a simple plot fueled by a cast of extraordinary actors and a spine-chilling soundtrack which goes perfect with the protagonist's actions. With a couple of gory scenes, the movie can feel a bit heavy to handle. The movie, with beautiful cinematography ,successfully captures the essence Prince Clown of Gotham!"
10/10,Watch it now in theater or regret later by watching on tv.,regmiwork,10/30/2019,This is the movie that makes you unsatisfied. Unsatisfied because you don't wanna stop the screen presence of Joaquin till the end of the movie... and even after.. Masterpiece 😎

10/10,MASTERPIECE,K1NGN31L,10/28/2019,"I was highly sceptical at first regarding how the movie will turn out to be, going by the plot, I had no doubts about Joaquin, one of the best actors of his generation.I am so unbelievably impressed by his acting, Todd's direction, the sound, the score, cinematography, the 80s vibe. Its been YEARS I've seen such a great movie with great everything in it. I can understand why some of the critics dislike this movie while they like similar or even more hardcore movies compared to this, one of the main reason has to go to the realistic feel of this movie, i have never seen acting like that ever before. The movie is so realistic and it tackles real life issues that ought to make anyone uncomfortable but in a positive way, i do not think this movie has the potential to incite gun violence etc(please, john wick anyone?), those are just rubbish. And lastly, we can not compare Heath and Joaquin's Joker, they are a class of their own."

If you ever were bullied or have had depressions and felt like everybody is against you, you will feel with the joker through the whole movie.This movie is unsettling from the get go and gets only worse from there on (but in a good way:)). As we witness how the character - Arthur Fleck, who will become the joker - is gradually sinking into insanity, caused by the selfish and cold world he lives in and by his own psyche.The role of the Joker is delivered brilliantly by Joaquine Phoenix, who in my opinion, deserves an oscar for it.But beware!Its a movie unlike other superhero movies. This one is more of a character study of the joker, why he became who he is. I would sort it into the Genre of Drama/Thriller."

10/10,A thought provoking masterpiece that tells a story you never thought hard about.,Olicosmic,10/16/2019,"As someone who isn't that big of a fan of the DCEU thanks to the quality of the films being kind of wonky (a few are great, a few are just okay, a few are really bad), I wasn't expecting that much here, considering that this film, besides having the Joker, has nothing to even do with the DCEU. Plus, as great as Joaquin Phoenix is as an actor, he was never exactly the first guy to come to mind when thinking of who to play the demented clown himself. So, you can imagine my shock and amazement after coming out of the movie theater, because, oh my god, this film is incredible. It takes everything you thought you knew about the Joker and not only flips it on its head, but expands upon it tenfold. The way this film portrays what Arthur is going through and how he evolves into the Joker is some of the best character development I have ever seen in a film. This film has a perfect balance of making you sympathize with the main character, while also making you mindful of the terrible acts he has done. It can feel a bit disturbing to almost side with someone who's obviously dangerous, but the way this film manages that is genius. All of this is helped by two things. Smart and excellent writing, as well as the performance. The story is great. It's well paced, thought provoking, smart, poignant, and constantly almost eye opening. Joaquin Phoenix was pretty much perfect. His performance is Oscar worthy here, as he really did become the main character. When Arthur laughed because of his condition, I really felt the pain behind it. Seeing how his life is and how he lives it really seemed real, and that's what helped me sympathize with him, even though, again, he's dangerous. If all of that wasn't enough, everything else about this movie is great too. The direction from Todd Phillips really shines, as the way this film is structured and put together helps the film not only flow really well, but to be delightfully dark and twisted. The performances from everyone else were all great too. Robert De Niro was phenomenal as Murray Franklin, as he was very committed, which helped him really turn into the talk show host from this film. The same thing can be said for everyone else, whether it be Frances Conroy as Arthur's mother or Zazie Beetz as his love interest. Everyone did great, as well as Todd Phillips for making such an incredible film that delves into the mind of the demented clown while making it extremely heartfelt. I also loved how they linked the Wayne family to the story. I won't say what happened to avoid spoilers, but that really helped this feel like a true part of Batman's past, all of which happened in a movie where the caped crusader isn't even around yet (I hope, because a Batman film after this would be awesome in my opinion). Overall, this film is amazing, and I recommend anyone who hasn't seen it to do so, because it not only has fan service aplenty to longtime fans of the Joker, but it also has everything that makes a great movie great so that it can be enjoyed by anyone. One last thing to note is that there is a lot, and I mean a LOT of gore in this film, so if you're squeamish about that, then I'd probably wait until I'm ready to see it. I say watch this with an open mind, and what you'll experience is a thought provoking masterpiece that tells a story you never thought hard about and tells it damn near perfectly."

10/10,Absolutely phenomenal.,christianwalsh-28877,10/14/2019,It was a privilege to experience this film. Joaquin Phoenix exceeds expectations in every aspect. Director Todd Phillips does an amazing job of delivering such an exhilarating character piece even given the film's contrast to those that he has directed in the past. Joker speaks an unspoken truth about the human condition and is an absolute must-watch.
10/10,Amazing!,meganteal,10/14/2019,"This movie was absolutely amazing in every way. I'm so glad they finally displayed mental illness in the correct way and although he was/ is the bad guy, it also sheds light on what causes someone like him to snap. I would watch it over and over again. The actor deserves an Oscar. He was awesome."
10/10,Brilliantly done!,woodymichaelj,10/13/2019,"If you walked out of this, give it a few... Frozen 2 will be out soon enough."
10/10,A new classic,ivanmessimilos,10/13/2019,"I have to admit that I had a certain fear to this film.The first thing I'm a big DC fan, the Joker is my favorite DC villain, and to make a movie about him without Batman, somehow illogical and unimaginable.Second, the director is Todd Phillips who has now done only comedies (admittedly good and really good) such as Hangover, Due Date and Road Trip. I knew that Joaquin will be great as he has already proven and rewarded an actor with several great roles, but history has taught me that it's no guarantee because the last Joker was catastrophic and the actor is also a great actor (Jared Leto has an Oscar).I was so wrong.The film is perfect, crafty and brutal.Most of all it tells me that even after three days of looking at it, I still think about him, about acting, about scenes, about music, about a possible message.As expected, Joaquin was singled out by the big screen overall. Each scene is his own, he ate the part and ordered the desert afterwards. He brutally gave himself into it, physically and mentally. Honestly, it will be a bigger surprise if he doesn't win an Oscar, but it doesn't even matter given the award history. He showed so many emotions and layers of one fictional character on a larger level, leaning to the floor!Any comparisons to Ledger are unnecessary, they both did the job to the highest possible level, each with their own version that fits the film. Both are perfect.I did mind the two minor things in the movie, however they turned it around to fit the story so I have no qualms.I really like that this can't be called some kind of superhero movie that we've been bombarded with for years, it's a pure psychological drama. It reminded me a lot of the tone and atmosphere of Taxi Driver, even in some scenes one can see the impact and similarities in Martin Scorsese's film. It was as if it was shot in the 1970s which was Hollywood's prime golden age.Honestly, the reactions of film critics, ranging from disappointment to excellent, were not clear to me. In the last few years, you may have 5 films for which you will become a cult classic in the future. The Joker is definitely one of them.Purely subjective and well deserved ten!"
10/10,A painfully thorough diagnosis,kamen-kunchev,10/13/2019,"Finally we get a Joker who is not Batman-centered, a Joker who walks his own path and tells his own story. Thank you!This is the best 2019 movie to hit theaters and it will stay in the minds everyone who watched for a long time whether you liked or disliked it.It's not a movie for the critics' praise, rather than a medical diagnosis of our time. Should you fail to notice the message Joker brings, you might as well surround yourself with happy thoughts and watch a Disney movie."
10/10,One Word...Awesome,harshu111,10/13/2019,"I never write reviews for any movie. This movie made me write it, Well Joaquin Sir..Take a bow.What a superb acting. We start with having sympathy with the character and end up supporting him.Somehow we don't feel that whatever he does is wrong. It feels justified.Crisp direction and amazing background music.It's a must watch. Go and see it today."
10/10,People who understand love this film,gary_hooper1980,10/11/2019,I've heard a handful of people say this is a bad filmThat's there opinion fair enoughJoachim Phoenix is amazing in this to the point I think he is a better joker than Heath Ledger which is a bold statement as I loved Heath as the jokerPhoenix takes this role and runs with itI could watch over and over
10/10,Crazy Good Story,elicadena-74223,10/11/2019,"Joker was not only a fantastic story that was filled with emotion and intensity, it also portrayed mental illness as something that should be taken care of in the real world. When you watch Joker he does all these crazy things in the movie but the story isn't necessarily telling us to forgive him for his acts but more or less understanding him for what he did.The story was so well put with emotion and heart breaking agony for the main character and joker made it seem as if he couldn't take it anymore. Phoenix took his acting to a whole other level for this film and him and this film definitely deserves an Oscar"
9/10,Best film of 2019,stevekindon,10/10/2019,"By far the film of the year, Joaquin Phoenix morphs from Arthur to Joker seamlessly, and it isn't rushed, it just slowly unravels into chaos stunningly.Range of emotions, from shock, amazement & sorrow.A sad plight, perfectly executed."
10/10,Cinematic Masterpiece,mariamodena,10/9/2019,"Even days after watching this I literally cannot get Joker out of my head. It's one of the best films I have seen in years. It's dark, menacing, chaotic & yet beautiful. Joaquin's portrayal of Joker is simply mesmerising. His performance was chilling yet moved me to tears, just so inspiring."
10/10,Super Performance by Joaquin Phoenix,ryan_fb_zzz,10/9/2019,He really deserves an Oscar for Best Actor. Astonishing performance. I am so feel in his deep character. And I am sure that this film will sweep Oscars next year. This film is Super Contender for Oscar ! 10/10 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
9/10,Best acting ever by JP,tarek-kamel82,10/8/2019,8.5/10. Incredible acting by Joker. Should win best actor easily. Directing is also Oscar worthy. All in all an incredible film which can be watched several times with different interpretations. Will probably go see it again soon and the rating could go up from a 8.5 to a 9 once I wrap my head around it all. A well done film.
10/10,What a Perfomance by Joaquin!!!,tim_dejong,10/8/2019,Oscar worthy! Amazing mental twisted! One of my all time favorites!
10/10,Great Origin Story,ottochandra,10/7/2019,"I have waited this movie since Todd Phillip's announcement of this movie. Great Story, Great Acting, Great Score. JOKER deserve an Oscar Nomination. Joaquin Phoenix deserve An Oscar for his performance."
10/10,OSCARS PLEASE!!,leftnetwork,10/6/2019,"I went to the greatest movies I have ever seen in my 54 year life. Joker is not a villain. I gave it 10 stars, to the Oscar people it deserves at least 10 of those.Phoenix will receive an Oscar for sure."
10/10,Breath taking,jortiz-50409,10/6/2019,One in a lifetime movie! The plot will have you on the edge of your seat. Joaquin Phoenix deserve an Oscar for his role as the joker. Todd Phillips could have not wrote or directed a better script .
10/10,The most satasfying,amkoli-27758,10/6/2019,Not a single point in this movie will dissapoint anyone . As we know that joker in dark knight has set huge mark on peoples heart . This movie had not let its progress down . The most satasfying movie and really good thinking from director about how jokers life will be in his days . Brillant work
10/10,Loved it!,Clive_W,10/6/2019,"This is just my opinion but I loved the Joker, the performances, cinematography, directing, style, all build a great story. And the acting from Phoenix was incredible, he done a great take for the iconic character, and wow does he commit, with loosing the weight for the role, to developing the laugh."
10/10,Masterpiece,premk-25965,10/6/2019,"#Joker is intense, bold, disturbing, and surprisingly poignant at times. Joaquin Phoenix gives a stunning performance that's equally as disturbing as it is emotionally layered. Oscar-worthy in every way. Beautiful cinematography and an incredible score by Hildur Guðnadóttir."
10/10,BEST MOVIE IN 2019 SO FAR.,adismatullah,10/6/2019,"First of all, dont expects that you will get an action movie cause this film isn't an action movie. The experience this movie will give is unpredictable, the music, the cinematography, the character development, the storytelling, all of of this things looks solid. This movie deserve oscar. 10/10"

10/10,Mesmerising breathtaking jaw droppingly brilliant,ttwiersma,10/5/2019,"Someone pass me an adjective. Listen to no haters or outragers. Go see it right now!!!! Thank you for making this masterpiece. I hope everyone involved in making this film is proud. They deserve all praise. Just WOW. I spent half the movie with my jaw dropped literally. My faith in good cinema is returning. Knock Knock, I want more"
10/10,PERFECT,isabelsbesteves,10/5/2019,What a movie im still shaked best actor for joker what a master piece!!! Loved it
10/10,"Joaquin Phoenix, That's All",varun-25071997,10/4/2019,"Not a single Comicbook movie excited me until this one and that's because of Joaquin and Joaquin only. This character is tailor made for someone like him who has given terrific and criminally underrated performances over the years in films like The Master, Walk The Line, Two Lovers and Inherent Vice. Todd Philips made the right decision to a character study psychological film rather than the usual adventure/action.Gotham City is like NYC in 1970s/80s a city with massive wealth inequality, rising crime and brutal austerity measures. In surroundings like this, a fragile and broken individual like Arthur Fleck is bound to explode but how he does and why he does is what we see for 121 minutes. The undertones on anarchy, capitalism and classism is quite brilliant and this is one of the films where we cheer for the guy we are supposed to dislike.Joaquin Phoenix not only does justice to Heath Ledger in this film but creates an own legacy for himself. It's a shame that a guy who has given better performances in movies like The Master and Walk The Line will probably win his much awaited Oscar for this role, a highly popular character to get noticed."
10/10,Just Brilliant.,alexandrakisalexander,10/4/2019,"I understand why some people don't like the message that this movie tries to convey... but come on, we can't ignore Joaquin Phoenix's epic performance and Todd Philips' one of a kind directing. I literally can't say anything negative about this film. Just Fantastic. I would give it a 100 out of 10 if that was an option!"
10/10,A classic master piece already!,kiomarsnu,10/3/2019,"Words don't do justice to describe the amazing script, dialogues, story and superb acting in this movie. I am not going to bore your or steal the thunder of the movie with a long review, but let me tell you so far what you know through the teasers and trailers is simply the tip of the iceberg. There is a bigger arch and captivating story in this movie. I just watched the movie, and I am definitely going to watch it at least couple of more times before it is taken off the big screens."
10/10,Astonishing,kayleystamour,11/19/2019,The cinematic piece of art tells a unique and beautifully rethought origin story of the iconic villain Joker. Joaquin Phoenix's performance is captivating; everything from the way he dances to the way he forces smiles upon his face in the movie. The work of art integrates the stigma around mental health in our society today while dramatically showing how mistreated Arthur Fleck was by the fictional society in which he lives. Who would've thought that such a movie could be so moving? This film is special... the type that doesn't come around very often. It deserves endless credit and is 100% worth the watch.
2/10,As grotesque as a clown's smile,danny_1952,11/18/2019,"My husband and I went to see this film and found it extremely depressing. Moreover, everything is caricatured. What could be more normal, you might say, given that it was a depicting the life of a comic book clown?Christopher Nolan, the director of the famous Batman trilogy, said before it was produced that this movie would be useless. Simply because when it comes to horror, the less you show, the scarier it is. If you're told that there is a giant monster in the woods and it eats people, you'll laugh and not believe it or you'll imagine the most horrible monster there is; the most horrible according to you! What others show us is never as horrible for us as what we imagine.Here, to make things really awful, we sink into the worst possible melodrama. As if psychopaths had all been mistreated during their childhood, mocked in adolescence, misunderstood in adulthood without ever having anyone to help them effectively! But no, the vast majority of them were born with a missing bolt in their heads. Something was wrong in them from the start.Here, the director wanted to make us cry by portraying roughly the most cartoonish misery. Everything is in bold capital letters, underlined and highlighted to be sure that we fully understood that the main character didn't have an easy life and that our society is so rotten that we should all revolt and suicide out of desperation or kill each other to put an end to it all.In terms of the actor's performance, that's Joaquim Phoenix pushed to the extreme all over. In all his films I remember, this actor plays social misfits, loners unable to make friends, depressive people or on the verge of a nervous breakdown, misunderstood guys, sons rejected by their fathers, rebels, etc. In short, he only plays tortured souls. He even played a guy who falls in love with his computer because he can't get along with a real girlfriend. So it's normal that he knows how to play a crazy clown. Talent? If you will, considering the fact that he seems unable to play much else.This simplistic and gloomy depiction of society has already claimed victims. There are people who dress up as clowns and ransack everything in the streets and cinemas where the film is shown. It seems that some misfits wanted to believe that, as with the Joker, their misfortune depended on everything and everyone else. Their happiness couldn't certainly be up to themselves.Anyway, don't believe the good things that are said about this movie. And if you feel a bit out of sorts, don't go to see it, you'll make yourself more unhappy for a film that's really not worth it."
10/10,this did deserve higher than Oscar,bgi-57519,11/15/2019,this did deserve higher than Oscar
10/10,A modern masterpiece,royemelluish,11/14/2019,"I went to see this movie a couple of weeks ago expecting a decent movie. However, after I came out of the theater I was shocked at the level of dedication needed to play the Joker. Joaquin Phoenix had to lose a ton of weight until he was basically skin and bone and play a convincing slide into insanity. His acting is so amazing that you forget that you are even watching a movie at all, and it is so mesmerizing to watch his new take on the Joker. This movie was engaging all the way through and had a perfect ending to match. What a fantastic movie."
9/10,This movie is not for stupid people!,fdvogl,11/5/2019,"This movie was AMAZINGLY beautiful. I'm sorry for the people that dumbed this down to a ""social commentary""! They must have the emotional depth of a mud puddle. It shines a light on the darkness of untreated mental illness as well as cultural anarchy and instability. This was SO much more than an ""origin story"". It truly shows the inner demons and struggles that many have with social norms and the forced chaoticness of everyone's internal struggles with their own personal truths.This movie is not for stupid people."
10/10,Masterpiece,kutaibakhalid,10/31/2019,Probably the best movie Iv ever watched. Iv seen all the jokers but this one deserve the oscar.
10/10,Amazing !,sandrabower68,10/25/2019,"One of the best films I've seen. Joaquin Phoenix should get an Oscar for his portrayal of Arthur Fleck. The unraveling of a person suffering from mental illness was tough to watch in some scenes but I never felt his behaviour wasn't justified. I left the cinema feeling sorry for a man who'd always felt different and had been treated badly from a young age. JP didn't just throw himself into the role , he became Arthur. Not as violent as I was expected either so I don't reslly understand the controversy when it was released."
10/10,This is a movie that stays with you.....,ivan_,10/24/2019,"The anticipation that I felt walking into this movie is very rare. I can only compare it to the same feeling of walking into a Christopher Nolan movie or Avengers endgame. It's an incredibly high bar of expectation and there was a thick atmosphere of excitement in the theater. I found this movie to be a masterpiece of film-making with an incredible lead performance. It covers the full spectrum. Wonderful storytelling and emotional beats, mixed with powerful dialogue and beautiful cinematography. The movie doesn't shy away from violence, and there is even some humorous moments of levity among the chaos and madness. I can't say enough about Joaquin Phoenix. He's a very special talent. The subtlety of his abilities are a joy to behold. He's a master of his craft. There are many standout moments in this movie and it tackles many very real issues - such as mental health awareness and social isolation. Highly recommended."
10/10,Unparalleled,nickleykevin,10/24/2019,"Incredible, believable depiction of not only mental illness but of a man who can be seen as a legitimate human being in the real world. Unlike Heath (RIP), this Joker is less of a ""performance"" and more of a legitimate depiction of the real mental illness GOOD people face. He reconstructs what ""good"" truly is and, in contrast, the powers that be define what ""good"" is for their own advantage.Rant/related to movie content:The wealthy make laws to ***k all the other people they deem inferior or unwealthy, and a lot of us really are ***ked by the likes of these elitist egotistical devils.Anyways, enough of that. Watch the movie."
8/10,Not everyone's cup of tea,isskrisktyliai,10/24/2019,"If you are someone, who is a bit more sensitive and is scared of violent movies, this movie will touch you.If you are someone, who expects a lot of action and does not bother with violence, this movie can be disappointing.To me it feels that this movie was more about getting a message about nowadays society sent to everyone and also about getting a performance of a lifetime for Joaquin Phoenix than actually about the story itself or Joker.I enjoyed it but expected more. When the movie ended, this is where I actually wanted for the movie to begin as it seemed like the actual beginning of Joker!"
10/10,Joker = Masterpiece!,dejopc,10/24/2019,Maybe the best movie in about 20 years or so. I was just blown away.
10/10,So real it's uncomfortable,SamRWeiler,10/21/2019,"This movie is depressing, brilliant and so real it's uncomfortable to watch. That being said, Joaquin Phoenix delivers the best acting I have ever seen and this movie delivers a very realistic look at how the unfortunate, mentally ill, weak and awkward live as well as how they are treated. By the end of this movie, I found myself actually cheering for The Joker fueled by the compassion and sorrow I had for his hardships and the lack of support he sustained from a society that not only failed him but made it clear that no one really cares. It leaves you with the realization that yep, this is the world we live in, the real world, where the rich and privileged rule. I wanted The Joker to make his official appearance and cause an uprising of people who are so sick of being ignored and treated like dirt that they find a hero from a crazy, violent, broken man. This movie does not hold back, it comes at you full force and stirs emotions that are confusing. We're not supposed to cheer for the villain. But then, who is actually the villain?"
10/10,Joker is a masterpiece,gabriouchka,10/21/2019,"I can't believe that avengers as a better rating, that people cried and clapped at the end of avengers, full blown standing ovation, i was ready to get up at the end lOf joker and clap as hard as i could, i knew it, i was sure about it, it was the best movie of the years maybe even the decade, but no, i was the only one with my brother and one other guy who got up and clapped at how good the movie, but nobody else...Joker is a dark and slow drama/thriller about a man living in a bad and difficult place, this place is called Gotham, you already know this place by heart as a fan, am I right?No, the joker will surprise you on every point, the soundtrack, the twist, the performance of Joaquin Phoenix. Everything makes sense and is really well put and done in this film. You are not only following a terrible man who wants to destroy the world, no, you are following the growing hatred of a man who has tried everything to be happy but will never be.It's a masterpiece that people will be talking about for years and oh my God, please. This film needs a better audience rating than the other shameless, useless and senseless disgusting things called avengers."
10/10,WOW!!!,rbrady789,10/21/2019,"Best DC/Marvel movie by a mile! Best Dark movie ever! Phoenix's performance as good as I've ever seen! If he doesn't win the Oscar then the Oscars are a Joke (pun intended)! OK, some parts are predictable but who cares! Too good to miss. Takes Dark to a whole new blacker level! A must see Masterpiece!!"
10/10,WHAT A MOVIE! One of the best movies ever!!!!,mrinabg,10/17/2019,"That movie got me like no other has ever had. I couldn't even breath at some parts. What a great actor, what a great story. The movie was only started for 10 minutes and I was already like ""WHAT A GREAT ACTOR"". I've missed movies like this. You can't get distracted by anything while watching this movie, is just amazing. Have no words. What a movie... INCREDIBLE! Give that man an Oscar, please!!!!"
10/10,Masterpiece not a movie,lailasefanovska,10/14/2019,"This. Was. Simply. BRILLIANT! Everything seemed so well thought out, so remarkably executed and so on... Would love to go and see this movie once again for sure."

The Dark KnightTime line would be out or would it ? Depending how you explain the ending"
10/10,Oscar worthy performance,loriic,10/12/2019,What a movie?!I loved every second of this movie. Not only it explains Joker it really restarts Batman.Joaquin Phoenix deserves an Oscar and the movie as well! Music too.
10/10,An amazing movie in the overly commercialized industry,jennie-740-337585,10/12/2019,This is my first time ever writing s comment and this definitely worths a 10. The story is told in a such a contradictory way that can be so touching at the same time.
9/10,Joker review:,danielx-83141,10/12/2019,"Joker (2019) tells a story about an unbalanced comedian named Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) being disregarded by society. He goes upon a path of self-discovery, in which his mental condition gets worse as the movie progresses.On the same note, the movie's plot was inspired by both Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy. That being said, the movie still manages to find its unique tone without completely copying one of the movie's narrative.Joaquin Phoenix delivers a oscar-worthy performance. His performance was jaw-dropping - no joke! He went through an extraordinary transformation throughout the entire course of the movie. You really feel sympathy for this guy, and you want him to achieve his goal. That's how good Joaquin is.This movie is, without a doubt, a piece of art. Whether it's the cinematography, the soundtrack or the cast themselves, they all deliver on it flawlessly.That being said, this movie is absolutely not for the faint of heart. It contains graphic violence, language, and it can be sometimes pretty depressing. It touches upon various subjects that you don't usually see in a standard Hollywood movie nowadays. Such as: anxiety depression and society itself etc. To some, it can be a problem. Therefore, I wouldn't recommend it for those kinds of people.Verdict: despite its controversy it gained in the past few weeks, Joker proves that there's so much more you can do with a standard comic book movie rather than watching it and forgetting about it afterwards. On the contrary, it approaches the viewers, and it makes them ask questions and think about the movie's existence, and what it has to say. I want to see more movies being made like this. Honestly, I was kind of sick of superhero movies, up until I saw this one. It gave me hope. It shows that there's more you can do with this medium."
10/10,Absolutely stunning,josh-251-37294,10/11/2019,"A masterpiece in character acting, Joaquin is stunning."

9/10,A Breath of Fresh Cinema,JACKTHEJAMES,10/8/2019,"Bursting with emotion. This film has won me over and dug me out of a ditch of cheap CGI fan fare.Absolutely outstanding. Really well filmed. It's pace, tone and character impressions really pay off. Most of the time you like your sat on the edge of Joaquin's feelings.Joker is a classic. And a cinema masterpiece. It was beautifully filmed."
9/10,"Haters, why so serious? Art is art there is no right or wrong.",indritedjakusuma,10/8/2019,"Cinematography was top notch, personally i love the tones on every scenes, the details, the camera movement, the backdrops, mostly everything visual about this movie, i love.Joaquin Phoenix did an amazing job performing his role, that's for sure. But comparing it with Heath's Joker, was unacceptable. Both did amazingly great job, both presented the role best on its own way, there's no way to decide which one is larger.Overall, i agree that this movie is not for everyone. And i personally, enjoy this movie truly as an art. True arts can be both sad and happy, ugly and beautiful, understood and confusing, love and hate, all those mix feelings at the same time.So, how do you take your arts, it's totally up to you. Cheers."
9/10,Deep-dive into Madness,aaronjbong,10/8/2019,"""Joker"" is not a comic-book movie. It's a gritty, psychological thriller that delves into the mind of one lonely man, who is subject to the cruelties and neglect of society, and finally dissolves into a path of insanity that leaves him irredeemable. It's unsettling and so grounded in reality that while it does take some inspiration from ""Killing Joke"", Todd Phillips generates an original story that ultimately reinvents the character of the Joker.That being said, a comparison to Heath Ledger's Joker is just not applicable. Firstly, it's an origin story so that immediately removes the aura of mystery Ledger's Joker. The Joker in ""The Dark Knight"" is just a being of unknown origin, present to wreck havoc and be the perfect antithesis to what Batman stands for. ""Joker"" is about a lonely man named Arthur Fleck who gradually descends to into a being of madness who happens to be called the ""Joker"". He's not really the Joker from the comics. Perhaps that's because it's an origin story so that some of his most defining characteristics like his charm and genius-intellect are not fully-fleshed out yet. I totally respect the decision to totally reinvent the Joker, but I missed those aspects of the character, and ultimately, I'm hesitant to call Arthur Fleck the Joker.Despite the radically different character, Joaquin Phoenix slays his portrayal of this man. This movie is a showcase of his performance and cements the fact that the Joker is probably, if not already, the most coveted comic-book character to be portrayed in cinema. There are side characters portrayed by Robert DeNiro, Zazie Beetz, etc. However, this is Phoenix's show and his performance was brilliant, haunting, disturbing and moving. His interpretation of the Joker laugh is so nuanced, that it's more than just a trademark of a character. You can see and hear the pain, sadness, anger from his laughs as he ponders whether his life is a tragedy or comedy. He brought new dimensions to the Joker character, leading us at one point to empathize with him, his sorrow, and we watch helplessly as his character just falls into a path of no return.The script is well-polished and I appreciate that it takes its time and opts for a slow pace to ensure that Arthur Fleck's transition is natural, not forced and abrupt. The result is a dark brooding thriller which I feel can be segmented into two parts; the first of which depicts the crumbling of the wall between Arthur Fleck and insanity, followed by the latter half where things get unsettling and ramps up to accommodate Arthur's full transformation. Some scenes are disturbing, but that's what you'd expect to see in a movie that aims to delve into the mind of someone like the Joker. I do feel the main story arc is a bit too predictable, particularly in the second half of the movie. There's not a lot of impactful twists. That said, the score by Hildur Guðnadóttir is brilliant, as it compliments the dark atmosphere of the movie very well, with its sorrowful melodies and haunting background. It is music you don't want to listen to alone.All in all, ""Joker"" is a really good movie, and a very brave one too, bringing in topics that are relevant today. It brings to light the subjects of mental illness, and social neglect of those affected by the former. I'm not sure if it's really trying to make a statement about it, whether it's trying to say that anyone, if pushed enough, can be someone like the Joker. That would sort of take the ""special"" out of the Joker's character. It's definitely not the typical comic-book movie and the Joker here is not the Joker you typically know. But it is a very good psychological character study of a man crumbling to madness, powered by the brilliant performance of Joaquin Phoenix."
9/10,Totally worth wacthing!,subxerogravity,10/4/2019,"Yeah, they did turn the archetype of arch enemy into the anti hero but I was expecting that in a solo movie.I'm sure everyone has had that moment when the world pushes them too far and you wanted to push back as hard as you felt they pushed you, but instead of doing that you go and watch the movie Joker. especially with others who understand how your feel.Joaquin Phoenix was brilliant in this film. Too bad with all the controversy he won't win an Oscar form it. It's the perfect academy award winning movie too, Phoenix as the Joker out shines he movie but unlike other Oscar contenders this year like Judy, The movie shines pretty brightly on it's own.Loved the connection between the Joker and his greatest enemy that could have went badly but it worked out well.It's a slow movie but I found Phoenix humorous. Not a violent as I though more like a lot intent for violence then small quick burst of it. I understand how this movie could be looked at as a bad stigma for the mentally ill, but for me, the flick easily told a tale of frustration and anger for anyone who knows what it truly feels like to be pushed around. It's good that he does not randomly target anyone, Anyone that get hurt by the joker is someone who (he felt) hurt him. It's the perfect origin of a supervillain. Overall it's worth it to see that transformation."
9/10,A brilliant movie,adityarocks-38866,10/4/2019,This movie is slow but never makes you feel bored. The story is narrated in a wonderful manner. This movie sets a good example for others comic based movies that how can a negative character can be portrayed in such a manner that you though know joker in not a good man but will be feeling bad for him at some point.The acting done by Joaquin Phoenix who played the role of joker was amazing. He was flawless and did proper justice with the character of joker which very few actors were able to do. Joaquin Phoenix is a brilliant method actor.This is a movie made to see in movie theatre not at tv or any streaming app.
3/10,Not equal to the sum of its parts.,wolfy3162001,10/5/2019,"Despite an extraordinary performance from Phoenix, the film itself is a sub-par experience. It's Taxi Driver lite, from someone who has seen the far superior film and completely failed to grasp its meaning."
1/10,Avoid !,richozy-81995,10/19/2019,"Possibly the worst thing I've ever seen , everybody else in the cinema thought that too"
2/10,It's for reviewers not for masses classes either,dr_hgj-48231,10/15/2019,"With some real good facial muscle exercises and some new condition display ...when disappointed starts un controllable laughs ... The screenplay, story illogical gun firing murders leave us clueless ! We have seen heroics of Joker in Batman and By Raj in an Indi Cinema but here one fails to laugh. Neither enjoyable as Joker's personal tragedy is going crime provoked path. Difficult to digest senseless out come of incidences. It measurably becomes a pot boiler. It's a fashion to rate this movie high just to give more complexity."
2/10,The Joke Was on Us,white-b,10/14/2019,"Beyond Phoenix excellant portrayal of a wretched mentally ill man...we felt cheated. Anticipated 10 minutes of development and the rest, villany. Sorry..this isn't."
9/10,Why can't every comic book movie be like this?,FilmFlowCritics,10/4/2019,"Since Joaquin Phoenix was announced to play the Joker, i was on the front of the hype train and usually that leads to disappointment, but NOT this time!This movie has such a gritty and realistic attitude towards it that my girlfriend (who has no clue about comics or Batman but i dragged her along into this!) asked me if this was based on a true story.Yes, the similarities to Taxi Driver, Fight Club and The King Of Comedy are obvious, but that doesn't hurt the movie at all. Some things you might see coming, which i usually hate, but this movie manages to leave more questions open, that it answers, so the enjoyment doesnt end when the movie finishes, you can debate about your theories for hours.I keep my reviews always spoiler free, I just wanna mention that I see what you tried here Todd Phillips, this movie is its own sequel - watch it and you'll understandA lovely character study and instant classic that will never get old. 11 years after Heath Ledger, this might be the next Joker that walks away with the little golden man, at least a nomination seems guaranteed!I can't stress enough how much i enjoyed that approach and would love to see more of these kind of movies, because this is what a comic adaptation really deserves."
6/10,Decent but not brilliant,weenash,10/17/2019,"Ok so been to see the JOKER on the back of all the reviews on here saying its a cinematic masterpiece etc etc, and while i cant argue that Phoenix certainly gives an acting masterclass the actual movie itself is dare i say it a bit slow, and a tad boring ( i dont care if you dont agree ) and as for the Joker himself he is no where near as good as the one portrayed by Heath Ledger and no where near as scary.The Joker here comes across as a sad pitiful character who in all honesty needs a swift boot in the short and curlies followed by a good wash.After i watched the Dark Knight i could not wait to see it again but certainly dont feel that way about JOKER"
10/10,Oscar,terassini,10/4/2019,"This is not a simple movie , this is a masterpiece ! To see something like this in 2019 is was shocking . I never thought that in my life i would ever seen that kind of act . And i want to thanks Joaquin Pheonix and the entire crew for such a great lesson ,and for his incredible brain strenght ."
10/10,10/10 no question,makedonasmi,10/3/2019,"Driving to watch it I was excited while expecting less. I witnessed film history, the work of the greats of today, a screen masterpiece, ""Tennessee Williams"" psychoanalytical deep trip, to be discussed for years."
6/10,Just OK,robert-johnson1,10/8/2019,"Watched the movie, it was a great performance by Joaquin Phoenix, but it was a performance of a man going insane. The story being about Joker is an offshoot. The Thomas Wayne character is overdone and cocky. DO NOT see this movie as a DC comic version of the Joker it is not."
5/10,This reinvention just doesent work,minesbay,10/6/2019,"Joker didnt have any of the clever banter that we have come to know and love from one of the most well known Villians in history. The pace of this movie was totally off and basically a snooze fest for the first 40 minutes. Joaquin plays a great crazy person, but this origin story doesent give him enough leeway to truly do this movie justice. Some of the mannerisms were spot on, but the demeanor and intelligence level if the villain himself totally capsized any Hope's of enjoying this. The killings were bland and did not bring any desperately needed artistic element to the film. Towards the end, the connection made between the death of one and the rebirth of another was probably the smartest scene, and simply not worth waiting until the end to see. I left the theater in total confusion and dissappointment."
10/10,Masterpiece,marshallsuresh,10/7/2019,Give this guy an oscar.. man i love his laugh. His joker makup. My favourate line is 'YOU GET WHAT YOU DESERVE'.. love this guy.❤🤡
3/10,Just phoenix acting,jain24sachin,10/3/2019,"Total flat storyline not a single peak moment, nothing new, nothing amazing, nothing entertaining except the acting. Just a man crying about his existence. We have seen this story a thousand times in thousand different movies also multiple times in batman too. We know that joker struggled a lot in his personal life as a common man, dull story ruined the character. I see people saying a lot good about it maybe just because they can't betray their joker but I like joker for his madness not his crying or sick attitude in his personal life."
8/10,Joaquin Phoenix steals the show,varunn-mohite,10/2/2019,As expected Joaquin Phoenix has done a fantastic job. Todd Phillips as director delivers a rounded film. The support from Director of photography and the music seals the deal.Story is a bit weak and lacks a punch that's expected from an iconic character as Joker. Joaquin's performance does cover up that but it's still pretty evident. Worth a watch
2/10,Terrible,jadersx,10/12/2019,"The only thing good about this movie is Phoenixs acting. But i dont (and most people dont) watch movies for acting alone. Good acting doesnt make this movie interesting, entertaining or give it a real plot. What a terrible script and terrible story. Barely any character development (or characters for that matter) outside of Joker. The last 10 minutes were the best part, but to force me to sit through the first 2 hours of garbage to get to it was punishment. Why was this movie even made? They couldve condensed the plot into a 30 minute tv special and made it better than what it was. I cant believe how overrated this movie is, but then again most movies written primarily for oscars usually are."
2/10,Terrible,frederikfs-47893,10/20/2019,"I don´t understand the critics this movie is awfull,it is very slow not a lot off action scenes,and jaquin phoenix plays the joker like a little child,the visitors that leftthe cinema left the cinema because the film is boringJoker is a joke and wenn that is the Joker that Batman challenged then Batman has a easy job"
1/10,What a waste,c-m-craddock,10/12/2019,I Have rarely been as disappointed in a movie as i have been with this one. I went in expecting a deep interesting and entertaining movie. What i got was an awkward incredibly boring film. All that hype for something that is 60% the joker being awkward. I kept waiting for it to pick up and become interesting. I was expecting something on the level with Heath Ledgers joker but it failed to gain my interest in the least. Like many critically acclaimed films this movie was a complete joke to me.
10/10,Am I a joker sympathiser? Yes.,manojmagecha,12/10/2019,"This is a standalone film for The Joker, to understand his character and really identify with his personality! welcome to the beginning of the end! The film compells you to believe the joker can justify his crimes! That one man does have the power to take down those who abuse their so called "" higher social status""A man whose childhood has been subjected to acts of Evil, and has continued to suffer more subtly throughout his adult life, we as the audience must believe he is out to force that evil upon the world! So that they too, know for a moment, what's it's like to be the victim! This is his reasoning! A coming of age depicts a character created out of pure Evil. A society which has failed to recognise and listen, a society where everything is seen as a product. A society which divides people and forces entertainment to be at the heart of people's lives, sacrificing the expense of another's misery along the way. Anyone with a heart will feel empathy and understanding towards the Joker.Batman is one of my favourite characters, becuase his abilities are not overly far-fetched, and the sense of what could be real is far more believable than having the ability to fly! But truthfully their would be NO BATMAN without the joker.And here you have Joaquin Phoenix portraying the joker in a light never seen before! His performance is remarkable, diverse, captivating and emotional!Honestly, this is the best acting performance I have ever seen, regardless of genre, since solo performances from the likes of Kevin Spacey.I am grateful to be one of the first to have witnessed such a powerful performance in the cinema on it's initial release date! And will continue to discuss this film, whenever the topic of greatest movies/ acting performances arise!Generations after generations after generations, this film should be considered as framework for Drama/Media/ filming students and people whom want to pursue an acting career.Joaquin Phoenix you are a legend! This was a masterclass performance and you deserve all the fame and glory at all the award ceremonies!"
10/10,Outstanding.,Alsmoviereview,11/19/2019,"I know the name Todd Phillips from his first feature as a student film maker, the 1993 cult documentary on extreme punk rocker, GG Allin, 'Hated: GG Allin and The Murder Junkies. Joker has a few references to GG littered throughout. Joaquin's performance is breathtakingly outstanding. Fantastic movie. 10/10"
7/10,A new hope for DC!,raghu-mktg84,11/16/2019,"""Every story needs its hero. And its villain. And its monster.""The Caped Crusader of Gotham City was never complete without his villain, the Joker. What made The Dark Knight (2008) a phenomenal success at the box office and as an all time cult classic was the characterization of the agent of chaos and seamless delivery of witful dialogues and challenges. It wasn't a surprise that the people loved the Joker more than the Batman himself in the film, for he, the Joker, didn't have any rules to play by. It was unfortunate that Heath Ledger had to leave this world, and thus creating a permanent vacuum in the Gotham City. There had been attempts by Jared Leto to fulfill the gap, but it is no match.DC had to come up with a solo Joker movie that was due for long. Joaquin Phoenix had been creating the buzz ever since the first look poster arrived and looks-wise he was almost..almost matching the legend of Heath Ledger. With much expectations, the Joker is finally here.Set in 1981, Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) is a disregarded personality who works as a clown at places wherever needed and lives with his mom Penny. With a rare neurological condition, he suffers from frequent and inopportune laughter which irks people around him. The city as such is infested with crime and unemployment all over, hence there is no question of sympathy or concern for special characters such as him. Struggling to make a mark as a stand up comedian, Arthur also suffers from delusions where he is unable to distinguish reality from dreams. Things go topsy-turvy when one of his colleagues hands him over a gun to take care of miscreants who harm him. Arthur uses it against 3 rogue employees of Wayne Enterprises. While the cops are in search for Arthur, he also is in constant battle to come up as a comedian, pursue his neighborhood crush, find out the true identity of his father and take care of his mom. When he finds an answer to most of these, how he handles them and emerges as the Gotham City rebellion is the plot.The movie has its high moments in the seamless change of expressions and body language of Joaquin. The audience will be in for a shock to see his shirtless episodes where he reminds one of Christian Bale from The Machinist (2004 The background score in most places takes the cue from The Dark Knight and builds over it to make us feel the connect. Also there are too many frames that resemble the ones of Heath Ledger, which possibly could be a deliberate attempt. ). For those expecting a Batman cameo in this movie - the answer is both YES and NO.While this movie could easily be a grandeur in performances, one cannot get the rush that was given by the one played by Heath Ledger. Surely, there cannot be a comparison to the 2008 Joker version, for that set its standards too high that any more attempts can only keep trying to scale up half way. We can only hope the sequel to this one has much more interesting elements, for the movie ends with enough scope for that hope!"
8/10,Wow,robotikarm,11/10/2019,"Started off a little slow, but it was all important for the development of the Joker. Loved this movie and Phoenix has definitely earned all of the praise. The ""statement"" of this movie is loud and clear and I think it needs to be heard by as many people as possible."
9/10,Sobering insight into society,wilmax32,11/10/2019,"Joker is an excellent insight (albeit exaggerated) of society's view of mental health.Arthur has serious mental health issues, caused or at least exacerbated, by childhood trauma and his relationship with his mother. Society isn't able to support Arthur adequately and his delusions and mental health are spiralling out of control. The movie allows us to have pity with Arthur, where it's clear that the 'system' has failed him.Throughout the movie society ridicules him, work mates, members of the public, the general population (via Murray's TV show). His interaction with the lady and child on the bus is a startling revelation as to how, even though the member of the public is made aware of his condition, still shows no empathy or understanding and merely shuns him.Under no circumstances can we ever condone the violence, but the question Arthur poses to Murray towards the end of the movie should be a stark warning.Ultimately, the way we treat our vulnerable members of society, our tolerance, understanding, empathy and support will determine who how society will develop. And we may well get what we deserve.This is exceptional movie and will become a classic (although won't be on each Xmas 😄)"
10/10,"About Joker, Batman and us",mazzobr,11/10/2019,"When Batman made his debut the year was 1939. In Europe, the nazism was offering a solution to poverty: the chosen and pure ones have to take the lead to organize a better life. This fascist thing was also in the air after the communism had shown its contradictions and violence. With the victory in the II World War liberal democratic countries had to propose a new version of capitalism. This human version, the Welfare State, went through more or less till the 70's when the neoliberalism arrived in the political scene advocating cuts in social expenditures and state shrinking. In a way, Batman and Joker were created from the same ground of despair and hope in the mid of the last century. We are now in 2019. The welfare state capitalism is in the hospital badly wounded. The evil may be explained by a real troubled life of the Joker maybe not. As Joker realizes his potency after every crime perpetrated by him, the young batman must accomplish a double task in the future: to turn Gothan city a livable place for all and to dismantle the joker's way of the necessary use of violence by the dispossessed. If Batman fails in this noble tale, the fascism will come again to organize the jokers promising a better life. Great Film!"
10/10,Brilliant!,nancy-793-228879,10/31/2019,I don't give many movies 10 /10 but could think how they would improve it. The acting was simply amazing. If there's no oscars then it's a travesty. It dark and scary. Deeply sad and tragic. Violent and bloody. Bloody brilliant is what it is!
9/10,A truly haunting character study.,domtaylor,10/31/2019,"'Joker' is the type of film that you want to rewatch immediately yet never watch again; it's as deeply disturbing as it is utterly compelling, leading to a unique experience that truly sticks with you. The pure visceral effect of it literally lasts for days, and once that wears off the narrative still lingers in your mind, something truly rare in today's age of cinema. It's an incredibly grounded character study, with one of the most complex protagonists in years. He's not a hero, but not quite a villain either. It's far more complicated than that, purely because it's simply far more realistic than that. Arthur fleck is just presented as a person, one who you aren't supposed to empathise with but rather pity. The film never forces you to feel a certain way about him either, as it just shows the events in a relatively unbiased way, which allows for different audience interpretations. The filmmaking here is fantastic, with everything from the cinematography and production design to the haunting score putting most films to shame. It still astounds me that Todd Phillips directed this as it's in a completely different league to anything he's helmed before. For all it's technical, behind-the-camera excellency though, there's no doubt that this wouldn't have been nowhere near as successful without Joaquin Phoenix's masterful performance. It has been said before, but it needs to be said again: this guy deserves the Oscar. It's far and away the best performance of the year, and is perhaps one of the best performances I've ever seen. Phoenix's mere presence here demands your attention and he completely throws himself headfirst into the role, outdoing himself in the process (a very high praise for an actor of his talents indeed). Sure, the writing is great too, but Phoenix completely sells Arthur's transformation in such a convincing way that I'm sure the performance could have overcame bad writing had it needed to. Thankfully though, Phoenix is matched by the film surrounding him, which just solidifies how great the whole thing is. Like I said, it's a very disturbing, even scary, watch that is completely absorbing from the opening frame. It's not fun, but it isn't supposed to be. It knows what it wants to be, establishes this very early on, and rolls with it, completely sticking the landing. It's an incredibly accomplished work and if DC stick to this route from now on, they'll soon become the leading company in comic book adaptations. 9/10"
9/10,Joaquin Phoenix Was Genius,Marwan-Bob,10/14/2019,"I'm Going to start with this : One of the Top 10 best acting performances I've ever seen, Joaquin Phoenix Was Genius.The Movie is Dark, unsettling, physically painful but in a good way.haunting score, Great Soundtrack, Incredible directing and screenplay, the only problem I had with this film is the ending a small problem really, i felt that it needed something more.Anyway this film will be talked about for years to come, i highly recommend it."
9/10,Critics show who they really are..,sinnfenian,10/13/2019,"It's a shame now adays that the so called know it all critics cant just watch a movie without injecting their own political spin on their opinion. A 59 metacritic for this while knives out started as 100 on tomatoes goes to show there is an agenda, and not a genuine critique.That being said, Joker is a phenomenal movie. It's a dreary journey through the mind of an iconic character and for the first time we get to watch every thread if his humanity get pulled away until he finally becomes who he really is, and to some extent, who we all are. The tone of this movie is consistent and his transformation is paces perfectly and believable. DC needed a movie like this to do this character justice in a way that did by look like it was drawn by Kane.Todd Phillip's nailed every aspect...from the music and timing of when and what played, the creepy and sullen atmosphere, the feeling of hopelessness till the final act...its hard at times to not root for the Joker even though you know what he becomes.I cannot recommend this movie enough. Critics have shown themselves and biased lemmings. Pay no attention to them. They are the very thing Joker is trying to stamp out."
9/10,"Brilliant, Fantastic must watch",ajaykotian,10/13/2019,Joker is a origin story of the infamous villian of DC universe. Its a mixture of violence and emotions. After watching this movie i have became a fan of director Todd Phillips (its the same guy who directed the comical triology The Hangover). His idea of presenting the story was fabulous. He knows how to intrigue audience with the story of the film. I have read many review of ths flim saying that the first half is slow but trust me i didn't feel that the first half was slow. First half shows the struggling mental state of Arthur Fleck aka Joker played by Joaquin Phoenix and second half shows his transformation to JOKER.About Joaquin Phoenix he just showed us a new version of Joker as the character was played by a lot of great actors like Jack Nicholson and my favourite Heath Ledger. Can't imagine how much pressure would be on Mr. Phoenix to play joker but he did a fantastic job👏. BGM also adds more feels to this movie.Conclusion : its a violent movie so very R rated but a must watch. A person need not have comic book knowledge to watch this brilliant peice of art as the movie has very less references to other universe. Everyone can watch this movie.
9/10,Incredible. Inside the mind of a budding maniac,grooz,10/13/2019,The movies makes you feel uncomfortable. You understand that what is happening is wrong yet you understand why...
10/10,Horribly awesome,chemistmoh,10/13/2019,"For me I call tell, this movie is one of the best movies I have ever seen in my entire life in term of acting, sound effects, story,..... despite of having very dark depressing moments in this movie, you still sense the feeling of greatness after finish watching the movie.First time ever to watch a realistic comic movie which made him a one of a kind.The problem is this movie might encourage some evil things in our real world to whose see themselves in this movie in a way or another, the fact that the moments and situations you experienced in the joker might happened to you through your life, how many times you got a depressing situations where someone enjoys making fun of you or mocking your life, character, origin, religion, skin color. Ideology or even just bullying you in school. Let's think about that. Hurting someone's feeling is funny it can destroys everything"
10/10,Old School,dozalp,10/11/2019,"It's an old school movie kinda like Clockwork Orange. The scenario is so tied and no rushing. It makes the movie untouchable, or I would say bounded. This is why It's strong and old school."
4/10,Not worth the ticket !,ryokhalaf,10/22/2019,"JOKER character should have been much better presented in a more psycho-path life. Suffering like in the movie is not a good cause for such a character to rise. I expected a lot from a movie rated over 9, and really disappointed with it. We were 8 watching and 4 said not worth the ticket. Hoaquin did a great job, but the scenario and directing were poor."
9/10,Makes The Dark Knight look like Disney.,aldo-64339,10/13/2019,"Todd Phillips and Joachin Phoenix have dug deep.. really deep, unearthing the first Joker character that is believable, not only in the comic book world, but in our world, the real world.The acting from Phoenix is stunning, almost too good at times which make some scenes excruciating to watch. A man's mental stability and health spiralling uncontrollably without filter. The cinematography is also spectacular, influenced largely on Scorsese's Taxi Driver as are other elements of this movie.There are also glaring similarities between this Joker and Rupert Pupkin from The King of Comedy, however De Niro's character study, in my opinion, is better, but only just.Todd Philips' direction is well balanced and he guides us between tension and climax just right.Overall, Joker is dark and not like any other comic book movie, which is truly a good thing."
10/10,11!,chrispeel-gsi,10/10/2019,Simply amazing. Could have stayed and watched it again. Wish it had been longer. Absolutely phenomenal film. Epic.
9/10,Amazing.,flavy_vet,10/9/2019,"Joker was an amazing movie and Joaquin Phoenix was perfect for this role, the acting was brilliant. Please consider that Phoenix's Joker is a journey to becoming the Heath's Joker and in my opinions it was perfect. Close to the end of the movie you can see a glimpse of Heat's Joker, the one that embraces his madness and starts enjoying being the villain."
10/10,11 out of 10🌟 not just a Masterpiece its a GOLDEN MASTERPIECE🏆,sahilbutt,10/8/2019,Oscar worthy performance by Joaquin Phoenix and incredible detailed so much power in todd mind brilliant direction amazingly written and outstanding score lovely combination thats what we called a True Masterpiece. All Hail to the JOKER.. i want this watch again ng again....
9/10,"Dark, Disturbing, Gritty, Adult, and Completely the Antithesis of Disney's Marvel",iamsam-89466,10/8/2019,"After I watched Joker, I needed some time to really digest it. Joker is like no other comic book/superhero movie that has ever existed. It truly transcends the genre and almost breaks it entirely. It is the kind of movie I have been wanting to see take place in the Batman universe since the Nolan films: dark, disturbing, gritty, adult, and completely the antithesis of Marvel and all it's Disney friendly content.Joaquin Phoenix is amazing in this movie. My wife asked me if he was better than Heath Ledger and Jack Nicholson as Joker. My first reaction was that he was not, but it is because he is playing a character for the entirety of the movie that is still in the process of becoming Joker. Phoenix has created a an original character that takes very little from previous Joker portrayals. It is so different from Heath and Jack that comparisons seem unfair and unnecessary.The movie looks fantastic and beautifully shot. You can really tell the Scorsese influence, but I am 100% of the opinion that this is not a copy of Taxi Driver or King of Comedy, heavily influenced, yes, but most certainly something new. Todd Phillips deserves credit for making a movie that does not seek to please the comic book/superhero audience and instead gives them something challenging like nothing that has come before in this genre.I do have some small criticisms in terms of the plot, but they do not plague the film enough to knock it down. I recommend this highly. (A-)"
9/10,Movie is Great. Haters Wouldn't Get It...,R_VN,10/8/2019,"Ignore these haters, trust me. They're extremely biased and are simply hating this movie because people like it and because they expect it to be something that it isn't.Things you MUST know before you watch the movie is that this isn't a ""Batman"" movie. It's not an action movie. If you're expecting a ton of action and explosions and a lot happening then this isn't the right movie for you.This movie is a drama. It's a drama about a man named Arthur and how he became ""Joker."" It doesn't really go into details or explore his childhood. The movie is about a very small portion of Arthur's life that happened just right up to before he becomes ""Joker."" The premise is pretty simple and not overly complicated.The reason this movie is loved is because it's beautifully shot and executed. The acting is superb, the cinematography is beautiful, the score is chilling, the art and flow is very poetic. This is not a movie you watch with your eyes. This is a movie that you must watch with your mind. It goes deep into the human psyche. It presents simple things in a different light. It dances, literally AND figuratively between light and dark, good and bad, right and wrong. You have to pay attention or you'll miss the message.I enjoyed the movie and I believe it's a type of movie that requires multiple viewings to get the full experience. There's a lot of subtle details that are easily missed even if you pay attention."
2/10,I want to kill now,paul_obe,10/8/2019,This movie made me want to walk outside and kill everyone ..... anyone who gets in my way from now on I'm just going to think of this movie and kill them all !
10/10,I cant believe my eyes- OMG What I have witnessed.,khanumar-61268,10/7/2019,I don't have words to explain the acting of Joker. Outstanding performance- What a legend. The Oscar is sure.
9/10,It was a masterpiece according to most of the audience who don't need money to enjoy and feel satisfied with a movie.,aravicmana,10/7/2019,"Joker was a complete masterpiece for anyone who loves a good dark piece of this world. The starting, the rollercoaster rides of emotions and the clever use of music were all points of minute observation. The trial of making it into the exact 70s climate was great with the super rats and garbage lying around. The movie surely is an eye opener in a way for those who want to understand the side effects of being under constant pressure and turmoil. The audience surely loved the impact it had on stigma against going to a psychologist. This movie surely is worth every penny."
5/10,Lacks one main thing- entertainment value,supergye-43876,10/5/2019,"Yes, Joaquin Phoenix does a wonderful job in his portrayal of the Joker. Albeit this Joker is plain and simple just mentally ill. He is generally portrayed in previous genres as a criminal genius mastermind. A person with wit, and masterful comprehension of trickery, and chemicals.This Joker is no fun, and highly delusional. You may question his intellect as he has to look up simple jokes in a diary he keeps. Yes, for the most part his jokes fall flat. Jack Nicholson' clever portrayal in Batman raised the bar that in my opinion has never quite been reached.I found myself uncomfortable with this portrayal as you would with someone acting out next to you on a subway. In that respect, Joaquin portrays this bit of brazen craziness to a tee. Craziness for the sake of craziness does not make for entertainment. If a sane person were locked up in a mental institution, you would not be entertained. And that is a bit how this movie felt."
10/10,My God,alismarthuman,8/31/2019,"Joaquin the Great..The Joker Genius.Creativity in writing, directing and acting.Incredibly crazy, but rational mad."
9/10,Unexpected,mattestella,8/31/2019,Very different from all the past interpretations of the character
2/10,Race to the bottom of obscurity,osito_parra,10/19/2019,"This movie is a rally to the bottom of obscurity - I strongly suggest not watching it if you can. It is, simply put: psychologically draining.The quality of the plot is mixed. It has some interesting suspense on how it all might end. Nevertheless, in reality some other parts of are rather predictable and obvious.Additionally, the rhythm is rather dull and it has none of the action you would see in the dark night (if that's what your looking for).It's also bothering to see how it portrays a divide in a troubled society. Even though we know Gotham is product of fiction, it draws parallels to our society - exacerbating its negative sides - while trying to make them appear normal.Also beware that some of the scenes are utterly grotesque. The violence is quite explicit and unlike other films - realistic."
2/10,One Great Performance. No Story. Needs an Editor.,baze,10/30/2019,"Unrelentingly, irredeemably dark with no story, no arc, and lots of unnecessary frames left onscreen. Too long by 1/3Phoenix delivers a fine performance, better because the material he had to work with was so weak and thin. I wanted to walk out from the halfway point onward but kept hoping for a redeeming 3rd reel.Nope. Just more and increasingly gratuitous violence, more darkness and attempts to clumsily weave in origin stories we have all seen. Saw this for $1.72 on a Season Pass and wanted my money back."
10/10,Idk why people are hating on this movie,bginnjr,10/13/2019,It's great. Just wow. Yes it was violent but it was less violent than John wick and Deadpool.
10/10,Oscar to Phoenix,crabsnco,10/5/2019,"Amazing hype and outstanding performance for Phoenix, now I feel bad for the Joker. It's not an aggressive play like I heard, it's all about action & reaction for a society which is full of haters & madness."
10/10,"Wow, what a f#cking masterpiece",boelbol,10/4/2019,"GO WATCH JOKER RN,Hounestly the best performance in a movie tied with Marlon Brando in godfather and heath ledger in dark knight, never have I seen such a well made comic book movie since dark knight, joker was amazing and it proves that comic book movies can be masterpieces too"
9/10,Pretty good but not as good as the people pretending,themightykazoo-30763,9/16/2019,This movie is probably about a 7.2. It is pretty enjoyable. It isn't as good as the people who are paid to post fake reviews here claim but those people are easily discovered by the fact that they rate every move 10/10.It is worse than the Dark Knight and I didn't find the Joker better than Heath's or Jack Nicholson'sThis isn't an action movie so people going into it expecting that won't get it but it is a good character study which unfortunately may be boring to many people. Reminded me of There Will be Blood than Batman
1/10,Overrated,jesserpenington,10/27/2019,I am a DC fan but this movie is a art house movie pretending to be a comic book movie. Boring and drawn out.
3/10,Marginally crazy guy loses job and gets predictably more crazy... The End,psychcowboy,10/16/2019,"Feels a bit like Requiem for a Dream meets Taxi Driver, but not nearly as good as either. Was there a single memorable script line or cerebral plot twist in the entire film? Not that I noticed."
1/10,Load of shxx,tariqakmahmood,10/13/2019,Tge film is too Slowt gets boringOk story lineGood acting from jokerI dont know what all this hype is about
5/10,Why so serious?,usualusername123,10/6/2019,"""Joker"" is highly derivative and a poor imitation of better Scorsese movies. The movie didn't really know what it was trying to say. On top of that it's very cynical and will leave you with a bad taste in your mouth. Great performance from Joaquin Phoenix but it's not essential viewing."
10/10,Darkest Masterpiece,kugami,11/13/2019,"Astonishing acting and directing, mind exploding scenes and heartbreaking moments that makes you laugh and cry at the same time. Just bravo"
7/10,I can't see this Joker being one step ahead of Batman.,jagdipatwal,10/15/2019,Other than that. This is a well directed movie with great performances.
10/10,"Movie of the decade, in my mind!",vadar76,10/10/2019,"This movie is a cinematic piece of art that must not be missed!People complaining that it was drawn out and had no plot are completely missing the point of the movie. It was a psychological analysis of a diathesis stress illness, namely schizophrenia. A man's decent into darkness after a childhood of abuse. It wasn't meant to be a Hollywood blockbuster with fast cars and CGI fighting rubbish.It was utterly necessary to have the elongated beginning, otherwise the brilliant cinematography and score at the conclusion would not have been so impactful.Phoenix, as usual, gave us a masterclass in acting. He lived every tiny schizophrenic moment of Fleck's mind and played it to perfection. If he doesn't win the Oscar this time, I swear I'll never watch it again!For me, this is the movie of the decade. I rarely see a movie twice, but I'm going back for this one a second time. 10 stars."
10/10,The Best Joker of all will knock your sox off,barevfilm,9/24/2019,The Best Joker of all will knock your sox off
7/10,funny like a clown,ferguson-6,10/3/2019,"Greetings again from the darkness. The first thing to know is that this is not a Superhero movie. In fact, there are no heroes in the movie - unless you would like to apply the label to a single mom who lives down the hall from Arthur Fleck. Mr. Fleck lives at home with his invalid mother in a grungy, run-down apartment. He works as a clown-for-hire, dreams of becoming a stand-up comedian, and depends on social services to supply the 7 medications he takes since being released from Arkham State Hospital. It's a bleak existence at a bleak time in a bleak city. Gotham is in the midst of a garbage workers' strike (only the 'super rats' are happy), political upheaval, and a growing chasm between the classes. And then it gets worse for Arthur.The second thing to know is that this is a standalone Joker film, and one mostly unrelated or not connected to previous projects featuring the colorful Clown Prince character played (and voiced) by such memorable actors as Cesar Romero, Jack Nicholson, Heath Ledger, Mark Hamill, Jared Leto and even Zach Galifianakis. Director Todd Phillips (who co-wrote the script with Scott Silver) is best known for such extreme comedies as ""The Hangover"" franchise and OLD SCHOOL, so he's a bit outside of his usual wheelhouse. Phillips and Silver seem to embrace not just the history of the character, but also the look, texture and tone of filmmaking from an earlier era. The gritty and outcast feel of Scorcese's TAXI DRIVER and THE KING OF COMEDY is present, and so are numerous tributes to familiar Joker moments of days gone by.Three time Oscar nominee Joaquin Phoenix plays Arthur Fleck, and he delivers Arthur's slow descent into madness, or shall we say further descent. It's clear from the beginning that Arthur views himself as ignored by society, while all he wants to do is bring joy and laughter to others ... and be noticed. His daydreams or visions of himself in a better world send a strong message. Phoenix shows us what full commitment to a role looks like. He lost 50 pounds, leaving a frame that contorts, moves and dances in a manner unlike what we've seen before. In fact, it's a toss-up on which shows up more frequently, his dances moves or his maniacal, pained laughter. We are informed Arthur suffers from Pseudobulbar Affect, also known as emotional incontinence, which causes that creepy laughter to pop up at some inappropriate times. Of course, the comparisons to Heath Ledger's Oscar winning turn in THE DARK KNIGHT are inevitable. The roles and films are written quite differently, and it's safe to say both actors were all-in.Action sequences and special visual effects are both noticeably absent, but the violence is sure to shock. This is not one for the younger kids, no matter how much they enjoy THE AVENGERS or WONDER WOMAN (or any other DC or Marvel film). This gritty, visceral approach is often a tough watch, and is much more a character study of mental illness than a costume drama ... although Arthur's clothes and make-up are front and center. When Arthur states, ""I have nothing but bad thoughts"", we believe him. And the sympathetic back story explains a great deal, and will likely prove quite controversial.Phoenix dominates the film (as he should), and supporting work is provided by Robert De Niro as Murray Franklin, a TV talk show host in the Johnny Carson mode; Zazie Beetz (DEADPOOL 2) as the single mom neighbor Sophie Dumond; Frances Conroy as Penny Fleck, Arthur's mother; Brett Cullen as a not so empathetic Thomas Wayne; and Shea Whigham and Bill Camp as police detectives. I'll hesitantly mention that Dante Pereira-Olson makes a couple of brief appearances as an adolescent Bruce Wayne, and just for fun, we get a shot of the young man honing the batpole skills he will use later in life. Just don't expect any ""real"" Batman references.Director Phillips delivers a film that looks and feels and sounds much different than other comic book movies. Cinematographer Lawrence Sher is a frequent Phillips collaborator (all 3 Hangover movies) and the dark look and gritty feel are present in most every shot. Hildur Guonadottir (this year's Emmy winner for ""Chernobyl"") serves up a foreboding score - one that never overwhelms, and one that contrasts perfectly with the more traditional songs utilized throughout: Stephen Sondheim's ""Send in the Clowns"", Jimmy Durante singing ""Smile"", Cream's ""White Room"", ""That's Life"" by Frank Sinatra, and Gary Glitter's familiar ""Rock and Roll Part 1 and 2"". The ""Smile"" song is especially relevant as its origins can be traced by to Charlie Chaplin's MODERN TIMES, a silent movie classic featured in this film. Phillips even uses the Saul Bass designed Warner Bros logo to open the credits, making sure we understand the time period (no cell phones, etc).The film traces Arthur's slide into crime ... a transition that he wasn't seeking, and one that he believes was forced upon him. His rise as a savior to the working class is secondary to his own journey, and the chaos is handled on the perimeters of the film, preventing this from becoming a Super Villain movie. Keep in mind JOKER played at Venice, Telluride and Toronto - three prestigious festivals. This is just another thing that sets it apart from others in the genre. Despite the 1981 time stamp, the consistent anti-rich message and class disparity is prevalent throughout. This appears to be Phillips' way of including a contemporary theme in a decades-old setting. And it's a cautionary tale that there should be no clown left behind."
10/10,"Ain't No Joke, It's Amazing",tlinsten-44374,9/1/2019,"This movie is absolute perfection, I was lucky enough to see this at a festival and WOW. Phoenix's performance is incredible and so deep into the role. He truely shows how damaged the joker should be portrayed as. He will definitely be at the top for best actor. The movie is disturbing and terrifying of how the world is to people with mental health and deserves to at least be nominated best picture."
1/10,Waste of time,precisionbeats,10/14/2019,Felt like a 2 hour trailer waiting for the joker while a bozo smoked cigs and walked around doing fk all. Finally the last 5 minutes came and i thought wow we have a movie then it ended. Id rather spend my 20 on some face paint and some pints and actually enjoy my life. This will go down as one of the days where the long awaited hype was flushed down the toilet. Thank you for that.
2/10,What a joke!,nmlal68,10/31/2019,"A total blunder. Joker is the worst kind of movie, pretending it´s deep, philosophical, structured and with a thorough plot. Well, it's nothing of that and it's as hollow as hollow can be. You take an exceptional actor, make him mimic de Niro in Taxi Driver, give him some eccentric dance steps on a staircase, produce a nice trailer, and.... voilá, you fool half of the world with pure nothingness. Joker. What a joke!"

10/10,Revolutionary!,kenankanat,8/31/2019,Joker Movie is going to make a revolution like Watchmen. It's just a masterpiece which shows our society.
1/10,Trash...,gabcekiskyte,10/13/2019,"Heath Ledger or Joaquin Phoenix? Here is the question. Except that in my mind there is no question. 100% Heath Ledger. And here is the reason why: while Ledger was perfect comic book character, Phoenix' character is more disturbing version of Joker. He is mentally ill and seriously needs help. I don't say that Ledger's joker wasn't crazy, He was somewhat crazy but in that movie everything is done in a way that we know it's comic book movie, good versus bad and that's it. 2019 Joker is more disturbing. There is a lot of emotion put in this movie which one would say is good thing but it's done in such manner that somehow we feel sorry for character and somehow even justify his actions. Violence is never the answer. No matter how bad your life is or how many people have hurt you, it is never an option. However, the creators of this movie seem to think differently. There you can hear triumphant music playing when Joker killed all those people. Also, movie is a shock value, unoriginal and uninspiring. The Dark Knight was really interesting movie to watch, everything was somewhat coherent in there. In Joker we have a lot of dancing, laughing, killing and mental breakdowns. To sum up - it's trash."
6/10,Did I watch a different movie?,jacques-28610,11/18/2019,"Let me start off by saying the cinematography is as good as people say. The acting is also truly impressive and for those that are not into comic book movies this should be a great depiction. But that's also where I find myself wondering how people are even putting Joker into the same ballpark as The Dark Knight. The issue I have is the same issue I had with Suicide Squad. The Joker isn't just an insane man causing chaos as far as he walks. He is calculated and intelligent. Striking the perfect balance between insane and I wonder is it all an act. In this movie I only witnessed an mental disturbed man with pain in is life go off the rails. I never felt he had the capacity to formulate a world ending plot, bit rather just finds himself fortunate to have everything fall in place. Still a great movie,it's just not The Joker."
10/10,A solid 9.5 if not the 10 that it probably deserved as well.,amnanzul,10/9/2019,"Watched this in theathre, everyone including me was glued to see the transformation of Arthur.To me, this movie simply is 'almost perfect'."
10/10,Disturbing and brilliant,geo-27015,10/6/2019,J.phoenix is astonishing in this gripping story of how the joker came to be.do not miss this movie.
1/10,Most over rated movie I've ever seen,mayfikyl,11/5/2019,The movie was to slow and had a lot of dead ends. He was crazy because his mom was crazy and he was abused as a child. There was no real point to the story. Maybe it's good if you haven't been around people with mental health problems but if you have then you probably won't like it
3/10,Why are we waisting a great actor on a half baked film,braidfan,10/17/2019,"Wow. I can't believe what I watched. Not in a good way. Although the filmmakers said this was ""king of comedy"" or ""taxi driver"" it most certainly is not. Sorry to be saying this. I wanted to love it so much, and it was only reaching an entertaining moment in the last 15 min when it actually starts turning into a comic book movie. Although Joaquin created a very deep and dark Joker, he has nobody to bounce off of. The character in a Batman or actual Arkham Asylum scenario would be very interesting I didn't find this version very interesting. Also unfortunately I don't see anything in this Joker movie that makes me think Todd Phillips could reach anything close to Taxi Driver. There were a lot of topics touched on (race, poverty, mental health, comedy) that never really felt like they hit a real point of view."
10/10,A Great Movie,kingofdeath_1997,10/7/2019,"Phoenix really did this role with a new style. It's REALLY PERFECT... Pheonix roll is CRAZY! I am a Joker top fan and I really loved it. The plot is amazing, and most importantly the message! Now Ledger is a thing and Pheonix is another. Everyone of them has his own style and taste. We can't compare them they're both great."
7/10,If you misunderstand evil you will unwittingly create evil,DanielStephens1988,10/8/2019,"Regardless of whether you like it or hate it, I think the film explores how the Joker is the way he is because he can't be otherwise, literally. One of the greatest dangers to America itself is American culture. It's not terrorism that will destroy America; it's American culture that will ultimately be the undoing of America. The film looks to examine our distorted points of view or detachments from reality and show us that WE, as a society, have the same characteristics of the Joker. The Joker is a product of this materialistic culture we live under. Epistemically western culture is motivated by striving for money, status and recognition, which is focused on results and efficiency but that can have severe consequences because you're always judging yourself with the person next to you.The movie Joker is what you get when you take American culture, and you take it to its pinnacle. When you exaggerate it to the extreme, you get someone like the Joker. But the critical hidden message is that we need to become more aware of our OWN double standards within ourselves. We need to start to empathize that we have the same mechanisms as the Joker has. So, on the one hand, I can criticize the Joker, but on the other side, I can also see why he acts the way he does, but more importantly see it collectively. Notice that trying to rid the world of evil only creates more evil. Everything you might criticize; corporate greed, different beliefs, religion, people you dislike, violence, war, mass shootings, even just hating this movie - We like to criticize things, but while we're criticizing, we're NOT really thinking about how we ourselves are part of the very same problem that is contributing to the cycle."
2/10,Shallow trash.,Windywoo,10/9/2019,"There is nothing that makes this a movie about a super villain. He isn't a criminal mastermind and there is nothing in this movie to make it fantastical enough that you would believe Batman could exist.That leaves a 2 hour film about a guy with mental health issues, delivered with a subtlety that would put Michael Bay to shame.This film pounds you with its message or lack thereof like Batman smacking Joker's head off a desk.Pitiful."

1/10,Just Plain Garbage,wfriesman,11/10/2019,"Everybody must have watched this movie with blinders on .it is not Oscar worthy ,boring as hell no dialogue or story to speak of .you cannot compare him to Heath Ledger or Jack Nicholson .His laugh is horrible.People are gullible spending money to see trash like the blairwitch project .I rated 1 star only cause couldn't do 0"
1/10,Overrated,analizatorica,11/24/2019,"Not sure what kind of message this movie is supposed to send. Or is it supposed to be just fun, because it's not. I don't sympathize with the main character at all, throughout the whole movie he would get on my nerves. I was waiting entire time for the plot to start revolving and when it finally did, the movie was over and left me with a feeling that I've waisted two hours of my life on nothing. For a movie with this high rating I expected to see something fresh and inspirational and somehow it seems to me all the scenes and acting I've seen in this movie I saw a thousand times in bunch of other movies, like it was cliche after cliche. Yawn festival."
1/10,Boring,monkeydjordan,11/12/2019,Well acted but entirely missed what the joker is. I was bored and found it lacking in anything of value. I have worked in mental health for many years and found this to be a poor choice of paths to take someone down. I found little empathy and even less point to this film. Joaquin Phoenix was brilliantly my score in no way reflects his acting he was simply awesome. If you liked Heath Ledger's portrayal then you will probably also enjoy this movie. This by itself and aside from the DC universe was a pretty good movie as a joker movie it was boring. I almost never give 1 star reviews but this one I could have not watched and been much happier.
